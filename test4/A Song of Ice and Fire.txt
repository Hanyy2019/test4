¡¡¡¡PROLOGUE 
¡¡¡¡Dragons, said Mollander. He snatched a withered apple off the ground and tossed it hand to hand. 
¡¡¡¡¡°Throw the apple, urged Alleras the Sphinx. He slipped an arrow from his quiver and nocked it to his bowstring. 
¡¡¡¡¡°I should like to see a dragon. Roone was the youngest of them, a chunky boy still two years shy of manhood. ¡°I should like that very much.
¡¡¡¡And I should like to sleep with Rosey¡¯s arms around me, Pate thought. He shifted restlessly on the bench. By the morrow the girl could well be his. I will take her far from Oldtown, across the narrow sea to one of the Free Cities. There were no maesters there, no one to accuse him. 
¡¡¡¡He could hear Emma¡¯s laughter coming through a shuttered window overhead, mingled with the deeper voice of the man she was entertaining. She was the oldest of the serving wenches at the Quill and Tankard, forty if she was a day, but still pretty in a fleshy sort of way. Rosey was her daughter, fifteen and freshly flowered. Emma had decreed that Rosey¡¯s maidenhead would cost a golden dragon. Pate had saved nine silver stags and a pot of copper stars and pennies, for all the good that would do him. He would have stood a better chance of hatching a real dragon than saving up enough coin to make a golden one. 
¡¡¡¡¡°You were born too late for dragons, lad, Armen the Acolyte told Roone. Armen wore a leather thong about his neck, strung with links of pewter, tin, lead, and copper, and like most acolytes he seemed to believe that novices had turnips growing from their shoulders in place of heads. ¡°The last one perished during the reign of King Aegon the Third.
¡¡¡¡¡°The last dragon in Westeros, insisted Mollander. 
¡¡¡¡¡°Throw the apple, Alleras urged again. He was a comely youth, their Sphinx. All the serving wenches doted on him. Even Rosey would sometimes touch him on the arm when she brought him wine, and Pate had to gnash his teeth and pretend not to see. 
¡¡¡¡¡°The last dragon in Westeros was the last dragon,¡± said Armen doggedly. ¡°That is well known.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°The apple,¡± Alleras said. ¡°Unless you mean to eat it.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Here.¡± Dragging his clubfoot, Mollander took a short hop, whirled, and whipped the apple sidearm into the mists that hung above the Honeywine. If not for his foot, he would have been a knight like his father. He had the strength for it in those thick arms and broad shoulders. Far and fast the apple flew . . . . . . but not as fast as the arrow that whistled after it, a yard-long shaft of golden wood fletched with scarlet feathers. Pate did not see the arrow catch the apple, but he heard it. A soft chunk echoed back across the river, followed by a splash. 
¡¡¡¡Mollander whistled. ¡°You cored it. Sweet.¡± 
¡¡¡¡Not half as sweet as Rosey. Pate loved her hazel eyes and budding breasts, and the way she smiled every time she saw him. He loved the dimples in her cheeks. Sometimes she went barefoot as she served, to feel the grass beneath her feet. He loved that too. He loved the clean fresh smell of her, the way her hair curled behind her ears. He even loved her toes. One night she¡¯d let him rub her feet and play with them, and he¡¯d made up a funny tale for every toe to keep her giggling. 
¡¡¡¡Perhaps he would do better to remain on this side of the narrow sea. He could buy a donkey with the coin he¡¯d saved, and he and Rosey could take turns riding it as they wandered Westeros. Ebrose might not think him worthy of the silver, but Pate knew how to set a bone and leech a fever. The smallfolk would be grateful for his help. If he could learn to cut hair and shave beards, he might even be a barber. That would be enough, he told himself, so long as I had Rosey. Rosey was all that he wanted in the world. 
¡¡¡¡That had not always been so. Once he had dreamed of being a maester in a castle, in service to some open-handed lord who would honor him for his wisdom and bestow a fine white horse on him to thank him for his service. How high he¡¯d ride, how nobly, smiling down at the smallfolk when he passed them on the road . . . 
¡¡¡¡One night in the Quill and Tankard¡¯s common room, after his second tankard of fearsomely strong cider, Pate had boasted that he would not always be a novice. ¡°Too true,¡± Lazy Leo had called out. ¡°You¡¯ll be a former novice, herding swine.¡± 
¡¡¡¡He drained the dregs of his tankard. The torchlit terrace of the Quill and Tankard was an island of light in a sea of mist this morning. Downriver, the distant beacon of the Hightower floated in the damp of night like a hazy orange moon, but the light did little to lift his spirits. 
¡¡¡¡The alchemist should have come by now. Had it all been some cruel jape, or had something happened to the man? It would not have been the first time that good fortune had turned sour on Pate. He had once counted himself lucky to be chosen to help old Archmaester Walgrave with the ravens, never dreaming that before long he would also be fetching the man¡¯s meals, sweeping out his chambers, and dressing him every morning. Everyone said that Walgrave had forgotten more of ravencraft than most maesters ever knew, so Pate assumed a black iron link was the least that he could hope for, only to find that Walgrave could not grant him one. The old man remained an archmaester only by courtesy. As great a maester as once he¡¯d been, now his robes concealed soiled smallclothes oft as not, and half a year ago some acolytes found him weeping in the Library, unable to find his way back to his chambers. Maester Gormon sat below the iron mask in Walgrave¡¯s place, the same Gormon who had once accused Pate of theft. In the appletree beside the water, a nightingale began to sing. It was a sweet sound, a welcome respite from the harsh screams and endless quorking of the ravens he had tended all day long. The white ravens knew his name, and would mutter it to each other whenever they caught sight of him, ¡°Pate, Pate, Pate,¡± until he wanted to scream. The big white birds were Archmaester Walgrave¡¯s pride. He wanted them to eat him when he died, but Pate half suspected that they meant to eat him too. 
¡¡¡¡Perhaps it was the fearsomely strong cider¡ªhe had not come here to drink, but Alleras had been buying to celebrate his copper link, and guilt had made him thirsty¡ªbut it almost sounded as if the nightingale were trilling gold for iron, gold for iron, gold for iron. Which was passing strange, because that was what the stranger had said the night Rosey brought the two of them together. ¡°Who are you?¡± Pate had demanded of him, and the man had replied, ¡°An alchemist. I can change iron into gold.¡± And then the coin was in his hand, dancing across his knuckles, the soft yellow gold shining in the candlelight. On one side was a three-headed dragon, on the other the head of some dead king. Gold for iron, Pate remembered, you won¡¯t do better. Do you want her? Do you love her? ¡°I am no thief,¡± he had told the man who called himself the alchemist, ¡°I am a novice of the Citadel.¡± The alchemist had bowed his head, and said, ¡°If you should reconsider, I shall return here three days hence, with my dragon.¡± 
¡¡¡¡Three days had passed. Pate had returned to the Quill and Tankard, still uncertain what he was, but instead of the alchemist he¡¯d found Mollander and Armen and the Sphinx, with Roone in tow. It would have raised suspicions not to join them. 
¡¡¡¡The Quill and Tankard never closed. For six hundred years it had been standing on its island in the Honeywine, and never once had its doors been shut to trade. Though the tall, timbered building leaned toward the south the way novices sometimes leaned after a tankard, Pate expected that the inn would go on standing for another six hundred years, selling wine and ale and fearsomely strong cider to rivermen and seamen, smiths and singers, priests and princes, and the novices and acolytes of the Citadel. 
¡¡¡¡¡°Oldtown is not the world,¡± declared Mollander, too loudly. He was a knight¡¯s son, and drunk as drunk could be. Since they brought him word of his father¡¯s death upon the Blackwater, he got drunk most every night. Even in Oldtown, far from the fighting and safe behind its walls, the War of the Five Kings had touched them all . . . although Archmaester Benedict insisted that there had never been a war of five kings, since Renly Baratheon had been slain before Balon Greyjoy had crowned himself. 
¡¡¡¡¡°My father always said the world was bigger than any lord¡¯s castle,¡± Mollander went on. ¡°Dragons must be the least of the things a man might find in Qarth and Asshai and Yi Ti. These sailors¡¯ stories . . .¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°. . . are stories told by sailors,¡± Armen interrupted. ¡°Sailors, my dear Mollander. Go back down to the docks, and I wager you¡¯ll find sailors who¡¯ll tell you of the mermaids that they bedded, or how they spent a year in the belly of a fish.¡± ¡°How do you know they didn¡¯t?¡± Mollander thumped through the grass, looking for more apples. ¡°You¡¯d need to be down the belly yourself to swear they weren¡¯t. One sailor with a story, aye, a man might laugh at that, but when oarsmen off four different ships tell the same tale in four different tongues . . .¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°The tales are not the same,¡± insisted Armen. ¡°Dragons in Asshai, dragons in Qarth, dragons in Meereen, Dothraki dragons, dragons freeing slaves . . . each telling differs from the last.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Only in details.¡± Mollander grew more stubborn when he drank, and even when sober he was bullheaded. ¡°All speak of dragons, and a beautiful young queen.¡± 
¡¡¡¡The only dragon Pate cared about was made of yellow gold. He wondered what had happened to the alchemist. The third day. He said he¡¯d be here. 
¡¡¡¡¡°There¡¯s another apple near your foot,¡± Alleras called to Mollander, ¡°and I still have two arrows in my quiver.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Fuck your quiver.¡± Mollander scooped up the windfall. ¡°This one¡¯s wormy,¡± he complained, but he threw it anyway. The arrow caught the apple as it began to fall and sliced it clean in two. One half landed on a turret roof, tumbled to a lower roof, bounced, and missed Armen by a foot. ¡°If you cut a worm in two, you make two worms,¡± the acolyte informed them. 
¡¡¡¡¡°If only it worked that way with apples, no one would ever need go hungry,¡± said Alleras with one of his soft smiles. The Sphinx was always smiling, as if he knew some secret jape. It gave him a wicked look that went well with his pointed chin, widow¡¯s peak, and dense mat of close-cropped jet-black curls. 
¡¡¡¡Alleras would make a maester. He had only been at the Citadel for a year, yet already he had forged three links of his maester¡¯s chain. Armen might have more, but each of his had taken him a year to earn. Still, he would make a maester too. Roone and Mollander remained pink-necked novices, but Roone was very young and Mollander preferred drinking to reading. 
¡¡¡¡Pate, though . . . 
¡¡¡¡He had been five years at the Citadel, arriving when he was no more than three-and-ten, yet his neck remained as pink as it had been on the day he first arrived from the westerlands. Twice had he believed himself ready. The first time he had gone before Archmaester Vaellyn to demonstrate his knowledge of the heavens. Instead he learned how Vinegar Vaellyn had earned that name. It took Pate two years to summon up the courage to try again. This time he submitted himself to kindly old Archmaester Ebrose, renowned for his soft voice and gentle hands, but Ebrose¡¯s sighs had somehow proved just as painful as Vaellyn¡¯s barbs. ¡°One last apple,¡± promised Alleras, ¡°and I will tell you what I suspect about these dragons.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°What could you know that I don¡¯t?¡± grumbled Mollander. He spied an apple on a branch, jumped up, pulled it down, and threw. Alleras drew his bowstring back to his ear, turning gracefully to follow the target in flight. He loosed his shaft just as the apple began to fall. 
¡¡¡¡¡°You always miss your last shot,¡± said Roone. 
¡¡¡¡The apple splashed down into the river, untouched. 
¡¡¡¡¡°See?¡± said Roone. 
¡¡¡¡¡°The day you make them all is the day you stop improving.¡± Alleras unstrung his longbow and eased it into its leather case. The bow was carved from goldenheart, a rare and fabled wood from the Summer Isles. Pate had tried to bend it once, and failed. The Sphinx looks slight, but there¡¯s strength in those slim arms, he reflected, as Alleras threw a leg across the bench and reached for his wine cup. ¡°The dragon has three heads,¡± he announced in his soft Dornish drawl. 
¡¡¡¡¡°Is this a riddle?¡± Roone wanted to know. ¡°Sphinxes always speak in riddles in the tales.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°No riddle.¡± Alleras sipped his wine. The rest of them were quaffing tankards of the fearsomely strong cider that the Quill and Tankard was renowned for, but he preferred the strange, sweet wines of his mother¡¯s country. Even in Oldtown such wines did not come cheap. 
¡¡¡¡It had been Lazy Leo who dubbed Alleras ¡°the Sphinx.¡± A sphinx is a bit of this, a bit of that: a human face, the body of a lion, the wings of a hawk. Alleras was the same: his father was a Dornishman, his mother a black-skinned Summer Islander. His own skin was dark as teak. And like the green marble sphinxes that flanked the Citadel¡¯s main gate, Alleras had eyes of onyx. 
¡¡¡¡¡°No dragon has ever had three heads except on shields and banners,¡± Armen the Acolyte said firmly. ¡°That was a heraldic charge, no more. Furthermore, the Targaryens are all dead.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Not all,¡± said Alleras. ¡°The Beggar King had a sister.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°I thought her head was smashed against a wall,¡± said Roone. 
¡¡¡¡¡°No,¡± said Alleras. ¡°It was Prince Rhaegar¡¯s young son Aegon whose head was dashed against the wall by the Lion of Lannister¡¯s brave men. We speak of Rhaegar¡¯s sister, born on Dragonstone before its fall. The one they called Daenerys.¡± ¡°The Stormborn. I recall her now.¡± Mollander lifted his tankard high, sloshing the cider that remained. ¡°Here¡¯s to her!¡± He gulped, slammed his empty tankard down, belched, and wiped his mouth with the back of his hand. ¡°Where¡¯s Rosey? Our rightful queen deserves another round of cider, wouldn¡¯t you say?¡± 
¡¡¡¡Armen the Acolyte looked alarmed. ¡°Lower your voice, fool. You should not even jape about such things. You never know who could be listening. The Spider has ears everywhere.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Ah, don¡¯t piss your breeches, Armen. I was proposing a drink, not a rebellion.¡± 
¡¡¡¡Pate heard a chuckle. A soft, sly voice called out from behind him. ¡°I always knew you were a traitor, Hopfrog.¡± Lazy Leo was slouching by the foot of the old plank bridge, draped in satin striped in green and gold, with a black silk half cape pinned to his shoulder by a rose of jade. The wine he¡¯d dribbled down his front had been a robust red, judging from the color of the spots. A lock of his ash-blond hair fell down across one eye. 
¡¡¡¡Mollander bristled at the sight of him. ¡°Bugger that. Go away. You are not welcome here.¡± Alleras laid a hand upon his arm to calm him, whilst Armen frowned. ¡°Leo. My lord. I had understood that you were still confined to the Citadel for . . .¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°. . . three more days.¡± Lazy Leo shrugged. ¡°Perestan says the world is forty thousand years old. Mollos says five hundred thousand. What are three days, I ask you?¡± Though there were a dozen empty tables on the terrace, Leo sat himself at theirs. ¡°Buy me a cup of Arbor gold, Hopfrog, and perhaps I won¡¯t inform my father of your toast. The tiles turned against me at the Checkered Hazard, and I wasted my last stag on supper. Suckling pig in plum sauce, stuffed with chestnuts and white truffles. A man must eat. What did you lads have?¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Mutton,¡± muttered Mollander. He sounded none too pleased about it. ¡°We shared a haunch of boiled mutton.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°I¡¯m certain it was filling.¡± Leo turned to Alleras. ¡°A lord¡¯s son should be open-handed, Sphinx. I understand you won your copper link. I¡¯ll drink to that.¡± 
¡¡¡¡Alleras smiled back at him. ¡°I only buy for friends. And I am no lord¡¯s son, I¡¯ve told you that. My mother was a trader.¡± 
¡¡¡¡Leo¡¯s eyes were hazel, bright with wine and malice. ¡°Your mother was a monkey from the Summer Isles. The Dornish will fuck anything with a hole between its legs. Meaning no offense. You may be brown as a nut, but at least you bathe. Unlike our spotted pig boy.¡± He waved a hand toward Pate. 
¡¡¡¡If I hit him in the mouth with my tankard, I could knock out half his teeth, Pate thought. Spotted Pate the pig boy was the hero of a thousand ribald stories: a good-hearted, empty-headed lout who always managed to best the fat lordlings, haughty knights, and pompous septons who beset him. Somehow his stupidity would turn out to have been a sort of uncouth cunning; the tales always ended with Spotted Pate sitting on a lord¡¯s high seat or bedding some knight¡¯s daughter. But those were stories. In the real world pig boys never fared so well. Pate sometimes thought his mother must have hated him to have named him as she did. 
¡¡¡¡Alleras was no longer smiling. ¡°You will apologize.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Will I?¡± said Leo. ¡°How can I, with my throat so dry . . .¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°You shame your House with every word you say,¡± Alleras told him. ¡°You shame the Citadel by being one of us.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°I know. So buy me some wine, that I might drown my shame.¡± 
¡¡¡¡Mollander said, ¡°I would tear your tongue out by the roots.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Truly? Then how would I tell you about the dragons?¡± Leo shrugged again. ¡°The mongrel has the right of it. The Mad King¡¯s daughter is alive, and she¡¯s hatched herself three dragons.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Three?¡± said Roone, astonished. 
¡¡¡¡Leo patted his hand. ¡°More than two and less than four. I would not try for my golden link just yet if I were you.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°You leave him be,¡± warned Mollander. 
¡¡¡¡¡°Such a chivalrous Hopfrog. As you wish. Every man off every ship that¡¯s sailed within a hundred leagues of Qarth is speaking of these dragons. A few will even tell you that they¡¯ve seen them. The Mage is inclined to believe them.¡± 
¡¡¡¡Armen pursed his lips in disapproval. ¡°Marwyn is unsound. Archmaester Perestan would be the first to tell you that.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Archmaester Ryam says so too,¡± said Roone. 
¡¡¡¡Leo yawned. ¡°The sea is wet, the sun is warm, and the menagerie hates the mastiff.¡± 
¡¡¡¡He has a mocking name for everyone, thought Pate, but he could not deny that Marwyn looked more a mastiff than a maester. As if he wants to bite you. The Mage was not like other maesters. People said that he kept company with whores and hedge wizards, talked with hairy Ibbenese and pitch-black Summer Islanders in their own tongues, and sacrificed to queer gods at the little sailors¡¯ temples down by the wharves. Men spoke of seeing him down in the undercity, in rat pits and black brothels, consorting with mummers, singers, sellswords, even beggars. Some even whispered that once he had killed a man with his fists. 
¡¡¡¡When Marwyn had returned to Oldtown, after spending eight years in the east mapping distant lands, searching for lost books, and studying with warlocks and shadowbinders, Vinegar Vaellyn had dubbed him ¡°Marwyn the Mage.¡± The name was soon all over Oldtown, to Vaellyn¡¯s vast annoyance. ¡°Leave spells and prayers to priests and septons and bend your wits to learning truths a man can trust in,¡± Archmaester Ryam had once counseled Pate, but Ryam¡¯s ring and rod and mask were yellow gold, and his maester¡¯s chain had no link of Valyrian steel. 
¡¡¡¡Armen looked down his nose at Lazy Leo. He had the perfect nose for it, long and thin and pointed. ¡°Archmaester Marwyn believes in many curious things,¡± he said, ¡°but he has no more proof of dragons than Mollander. Just more sailors¡¯ stories.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°You¡¯re wrong,¡± said Leo. ¡°There is a glass candle burning in the Mage¡¯s chambers.¡± 
¡¡¡¡A hush fell over the torchlit terrace. Armen sighed and shook his head. Mollander began to laugh. The Sphinx studied Leo with his big black eyes. Roone looked lost. 
¡¡¡¡Pate knew about the glass candles, though he had never seen one burn. They were the worst-kept secret of the Citadel. It was said that they had been brought to Oldtown from Valyria a thousand years before the Doom. He had heard there were four; one was green and three were black, and all were tall and twisted. 
¡¡¡¡¡°What are these glass candles?¡± asked Roone. 
¡¡¡¡Armen the Acolyte cleared his throat. ¡°The night before an acolyte says his vows, he must stand a vigil in the vault. No lantern is permitted him, no torch, no lamp, no taper . . . only a candle of obsidian. He must spend the night in darkness, unless he can light that candle. Some will try. The foolish and the stubborn, those who have made a study of these so-called higher mysteries. Often they cut their fingers, for the ridges on the candles are said to be as sharp as razors. Then, with bloody hands, they must wait upon the dawn, brooding on their failure. Wiser men simply go to sleep, or spend their night in prayer, but every year there are always a few who must try.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Yes.¡± Pate had heard the same stories. ¡°But what¡¯s the use of a candle that casts no light?¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°It is a lesson,¡± Armen said, ¡°the last lesson we must learn before we don our maester¡¯s chains. The glass candle is meant to represent truth and learning, rare and beautiful and fragile things. It is made in the shape of a candle to remind us that a maester must cast light wherever he serves, and it is sharp to remind us that knowledge can be dangerous. Wise men may grow arrogant in their wisdom, but a maester must always remain humble. The glass candle reminds us of that as well. Even after he has said his vow and donned his chain and gone forth to serve, a maester will think back on the darkness of his vigil and remember how nothing that he did could make the candle burn . . . for even with knowledge, some things are not possible.¡± 
¡¡¡¡Lazy Leo burst out laughing. ¡°Not possible for you, you mean. I saw the candle burning with my own eyes.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°You saw some candle burning, I don¡¯t doubt,¡± said Armen. ¡°A candle of black wax, perhaps.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°I know what I saw. The light was queer and bright, much brighter than any beeswax or tallow candle. It cast strange shadows and the flame never flickered, not even when a draft blew through the open door behind me.¡± 
¡¡¡¡Armen crossed his arms. ¡°Obsidian does not burn.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Dragonglass,¡± Pate said. ¡°The smallfolk call it dragonglass.¡± Somehow that seemed important. 
¡¡¡¡¡°They do,¡± mused Alleras, the Sphinx, ¡°and if there are dragons in the world again . . .¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Dragons and darker things,¡± said Leo. ¡°The grey sheep have closed their eyes, but the mastiff sees the truth. Old powers waken. Shadows stir. An age of wonder and terror will soon be upon us, an age for gods and heroes.¡± He stretched, smiling his lazy smile. ¡°That¡¯s worth a round, I¡¯d say.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°We¡¯ve drunk enough,¡± said Armen. ¡°Morn will be upon us sooner than we¡¯d like, and Archmaester Ebrose will be speaking on the properties of urine. Those who mean to forge a silver link would do well not to miss his talk.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Far be it from me to keep you from the piss tasting,¡± said Leo. ¡°Myself, I prefer the taste of Arbor gold.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°If the choice is piss or you, I¡¯ll drink piss.¡± Mollander pushed back from the table. ¡°Come, Roone.¡± 
¡¡¡¡The Sphinx reached for his bowcase. ¡°It¡¯s bed for me as well. I expect I¡¯ll dream of dragons and glass candles.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°All of you?¡± Leo shrugged. ¡°Well, Rosey will remain. Perhaps I¡¯ll wake our little sweetmeat and make a woman of her.¡± 
¡¡¡¡Alleras saw the look on Pate¡¯s face. ¡°If he does not have a copper for a cup of wine, he cannot have a dragon for the girl.¡± ¡°Aye,¡± said Mollander. ¡°Besides, it takes a man to make a woman. Come with us, Pate. Old Walgrave will wake when the sun comes up. He¡¯ll be needing you to help him to the privy.¡± 
¡¡¡¡If he remembers who I am today. Archmaester Walgrave had no trouble telling one raven from another, but he was not so good with people. Some days he seemed to think Pate was someone named Cressen. ¡°Not just yet,¡± he told his friends. ¡°I¡¯m going to stay awhile.¡± Dawn had not broken, not quite. The alchemist might still be coming, and Pate meant to be here if he did. 
¡¡¡¡¡°As you wish,¡± said Armen. Alleras gave Pate a lingering look, then slung his bow over one slim shoulder and followed the others toward the bridge. Mollander was so drunk he had to walk with a hand on Roone¡¯s shoulder to keep from falling. The Citadel was no great distance as the raven flies, but none of them were ravens and Oldtown was a veritable labyrinth of a city, all wynds and crisscrossing alleys and narrow crookback streets. ¡°Careful,¡± Pate heard Armen say as the river mists swallowed up the four of them, ¡°the night is damp, and the cobbles will be slippery.¡± 
¡¡¡¡When they were gone, Lazy Leo considered Pate sourly across the table. ¡°How sad. The Sphinx has stolen off with all his silver, abandoning me to Spotted Pate the pig boy.¡± He stretched, yawning. ¡°How is our lovely little Rosey, pray?¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°She¡¯s sleeping,¡± Pate said curtly. 
¡¡¡¡¡°Naked, I don¡¯t doubt.¡± Leo grinned. ¡°Do you think she¡¯s truly worth a dragon? One day I suppose I must find out.¡± 
¡¡¡¡Pate knew better than to reply to that. 
¡¡¡¡Leo needed no reply. ¡°I expect that once I¡¯ve broken in the wench, her price will fall to where even pig boys will be able to afford her. You ought to thank me.¡± 
¡¡¡¡I ought to kill you, Pate thought, but he was not near drunk enough to throw away his life. Leo had been trained to arms, and was known to be deadly with bravo¡¯s blade and dagger. And if Pate should somehow kill him, it would mean his own head too. Leo had two names where Pate had only one, and his second was Tyrell. Ser Moryn Tyrell, commander of the City Watch of Oldtown, was Leo¡¯s father. Mace Tyrell, Lord of Highgarden and Warden of the South, was Leo¡¯s cousin. And Oldtown¡¯s Old Man, Lord Leyton of the Hightower, who numbered ¡°Protector of the Citadel¡± amongst his many titles, was a sworn bannerman of House Tyrell. Let it go, Pate told himself. He says these things just to wound me. 
¡¡¡¡The mists were lightening to the east. Dawn, Pate realized. Dawn has come, and the alchemist has not. He did not know whether he should laugh or cry. Am I still a thief if I put it all back and no one ever knows? It was another question that he had no answer for, like those that Ebrose and Vaellyn had once asked him. When he pushed back from the bench and got to his feet, the fearsomely strong cider all went to his head at once. He had to put a hand on the table to steady himself. ¡°Leave Rosey be,¡± he said, by way of parting. ¡°Just leave her be, or I may kill you.¡± 
¡¡¡¡Leo Tyrell flicked the hair back from his eye. ¡°I do not fight duels with pig boys. Go away.¡± 
¡¡¡¡Pate turned and crossed the terrace. His heels rang against the weathered planks of the old bridge. By the time he reached the other side, the eastern sky was turning pink. The world is wide, he told himself. If I bought that donkey, I could still wander the roads and byways of the Seven Kingdoms, leeching the smallfolk and picking nits out of their hair. I could sign on to some ship, pull an oar, and sail to Qarth by the Jade Gates to see these bloody dragons for myself. I do not need to go back to old Walgrave and the ravens. 
¡¡¡¡Yet somehow his feet turned back toward the Citadel. 
¡¡¡¡When the first shaft of sunlight broke through the clouds to the east, morning bells began to peal from the Sailor¡¯s Sept down by the harbor. The Lord¡¯s Sept joined in a moment later, then the Seven Shrines from their gardens across the Honeywine, and finally the Starry Sept that had been the seat of the High Septon for a thousand years before Aegon landed at King¡¯s Landing. They made a mighty music. Though not so sweet as one small nightingale. 
¡¡¡¡He could hear singing too, beneath the pealing of the bells. Each morning at first light the red priests gathered to welcome the sun outside their modest wharfside temple. For the night is dark and full of terrors. Pate had heard them cry those words a hundred times, asking their god R¡¯hllor to save them from the darkness. The Seven were gods enough for him, but he had heard that Stannis Baratheon worshiped at the nightfires now. He had even put the fiery heart of R¡¯hllor on his banners in place of the crowned stag. If he should win the Iron Throne, we¡¯ll all need to learn the words of the red priests¡¯ song, 
¡¡¡¡Pate thought, but that was not likely. Tywin Lannister had smashed Stannis and R¡¯hllor upon the Blackwater, and soon enough he would finish them and mount the head of the Baratheon pretender on a spike above the gates of King¡¯s Landing. 
¡¡¡¡As the night¡¯s mists burned away, Oldtown took form around him, emerging ghostlike from the predawn gloom. Pate had never seen King¡¯s Landing, but he knew it was a daub-and-wattle city, a sprawl of mud streets, thatched roofs, and wooden hovels. Oldtown was built in stone, and all its streets were cobbled, down to the meanest alley. The city was never more beautiful than at break of day. West of the Honeywine, the Guildhalls lined the bank like a row of palaces. Upriver, the domes and towers of the Citadel rose on both sides of the river, connected by stone bridges crowded with halls and houses. Downstream, below the black marble walls and arched windows of the Starry Sept, the manses of the pious clustered like children gathered round the feet of an old dowager. And beyond, where the Honeywine widened into Whispering Sound, rose the Hightower, its beacon fires bright against the dawn. From where it stood atop the bluffs of Battle Island, its shadow cut the city like a sword. Those born and raised in Oldtown could tell the time of day by where that shadow fell. Some claimed a man could see all the way to the Wall from the top. Perhaps that was why Lord Leyton had not made the descent in more than a decade, preferring to rule his city from the clouds. 
¡¡¡¡A butcher¡¯s cart rumbled past Pate down the river road, five piglets in the back squealing in distress. Dodging from its path, he just avoided being spattered as a townswoman emptied a pail of night soil from a window overhead. When I am a maester in a castle I will have a horse to ride, he thought. Then he tripped upon a cobble and wondered who he was fooling. There would be no chain for him, no seat at a lord¡¯s high table, no tall white horse to ride. His days would be spent listening to ravens quork and scrubbing shit stains off Archmaester Walgrave¡¯s smallclothes. 
¡¡¡¡He was on one knee, trying to wipe the mud off his robes, when a voice said, ¡°Good morrow, Pate.¡± 
¡¡¡¡The alchemist was standing over him. 
¡¡¡¡Pate rose. ¡°The third day . . . you said you would be at the Quill and Tankard.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°You were with your friends. It was not my wish to intrude upon your fellowship.¡± The alchemist wore a hooded traveler¡¯s cloak, brown and nondescript. The rising sun was peeking over the rooftops behind his shoulder, so it was hard to make out the face beneath his hood. ¡°Have you decided what you are?¡± 
¡¡¡¡Must he make me say it? ¡°I suppose I am a thief.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°I thought you might be.¡± 
¡¡¡¡The hardest part had been getting down on his hands and knees to pull the strongbox from underneath Archmaester Walgrave¡¯s bed. Though the box was stoutly made and bound with iron, its lock was broken. Maester Gormon had suspected Pate of breaking it, but that wasn¡¯t true. Walgrave had broken the lock himself, after losing the key that opened it. 
¡¡¡¡Inside, Pate had found a bag of silver stags, a lock of yellow hair tied up in a ribbon, a painted miniature of a woman who resembled Walgrave (even to her mustache), and a knight¡¯s gauntlet made of lobstered steel. The gauntlet had belonged to a prince, Walgrave claimed, though he could no longer seem to recall which one. When Pate shook it, the key fell out onto the floor. 
¡¡¡¡If I pick that up, I am a thief, he remembered thinking. The key was old and heavy, made of black iron; supposedly it opened every door at the Citadel. Only the archmaesters had such keys. The others carried theirs upon their person or hid them away in some safe place, but if Walgrave had hidden his, no one would ever have seen it again. Pate snatched up the key and had been halfway to the door before turning back to take the silver too. A thief was a thief, whether he stole a little or a lot. ¡°Pate,¡± one of the white ravens had called after him, ¡°Pate, Pate, Pate.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Do you have my dragon?¡± he asked the alchemist. 
¡¡¡¡¡°If you have what I require.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Give it here. I want to see.¡± Pate did not intend to let himself be cheated. 
¡¡¡¡¡°The river road is not the place. Come.¡± 
¡¡¡¡He had no time to think about it, to weigh his choices. The alchemist was walking away. Pate had to follow or lose Rosey and the dragon both, forever. He followed. As they walked, he slipped his hand up into his sleeve. He could feel the key, safe inside the hidden pocket he had sewn there. Maester¡¯s robes were full of pockets. He had known that since he was a boy. 
¡¡¡¡He had to hurry to keep pace with the alchemist¡¯s longer strides. They went down an alley, around a corner, through the old Thieves Market, along Ragpicker¡¯s Wynd. Finally, the man turned into another alley, narrower than the first. ¡°This is far enough,¡± said Pate. ¡°There¡¯s no one about. We¡¯ll do it here.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°As you wish.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°I want my dragon.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°To be sure.¡± The coin appeared. The alchemist made it walk across his knuckles, the way he had when Rosey brought the two of them together. In the morning light the dragon glittered as it moved, and gave the alchemist¡¯s fingers a golden glow. 
¡¡¡¡Pate grabbed it from his hand. The gold felt warm against his palm. He brought it to his mouth and bit down on it the way he¡¯d seen men do. If truth be told, he wasn¡¯t sure what gold should taste like, but he did not want to look a fool. 
¡¡¡¡¡°The key?¡± the alchemist inquired politely. 
¡¡¡¡Something made Pate hesitate. ¡°Is it some book you want?¡± Some of the old Valyrian scrolls down in the locked vaults were said to be the only surviving copies in the world. 
¡¡¡¡¡°What I want is none of your concern.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°No.¡± It¡¯s done, Pate told himself. Go. Run back to the Quill and Tankard, wake Rosey with a kiss, and tell her she belongs to you. Yet still he lingered. ¡°Show me your face.¡± ¡°As you wish.¡± The alchemist pulled his hood down. He was just a man, and his face was just a face. A young man¡¯s face, ordinary, with full cheeks and the shadow of a beard. A scar showed faintly on his right cheek. He had a 
¡¡¡¡hooked nose, and a mat of dense black hair that curled tightly around his ears. It was not a face Pate recognized. ¡°I do not know you.¡± ¡°Nor I you.¡± ¡°Who are you?¡± ¡°A stranger. No one. Truly.¡± ¡°Oh.¡± Pate had run out of words. He drew out the key and put it in the stranger¡¯s hand, 
¡¡¡¡feeling light-headed, almost giddy. Rosey, he reminded himself. ¡°We¡¯re done, then.¡± He was halfway down the alley when the cobblestones began to move beneath his feet. The stones are slick and wet, he thought, but that was not it. He could feel his heart 
¡¡¡¡hammering in his chest. ¡°What¡¯s happening?¡± he said. His legs had turned to water. ¡°I don¡¯t understand.¡± ¡°And never will,¡± a voice said sadly. The cobblestones rushed up to kiss him. Pate tried to cry for help, but his voice was 
¡¡¡¡failing too. His last thought was of Rosey.
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡ THE PROPHET 
¡¡¡¡The prophet was drowning men on Great Wyk when they came to tell him that the king was dead. 
¡¡¡¡It was a bleak, cold morning, and the sea was as leaden as the sky. The first three men had offered their lives to the Drowned God fearlessly, but the fourth was weak in faith and began to struggle as his lungs cried out for air. Standing waist-deep in the surf, Aeron seized the naked boy by the shoulders and pushed his head back down as he tried to snatch a breath. ¡°Have courage,¡± he said. ¡°We came from the sea, and to the sea we must return. Open your mouth and drink deep of god¡¯s blessing. Fill your lungs with water, that you may die and be reborn. It does no good to fight.¡± 
¡¡¡¡Either the boy could not hear him with his head beneath the waves, or else his faith had utterly deserted him. He began to kick and thrash so wildly that Aeron had to call for help. Four of his drowned men waded out to seize the wretch and hold him underwater. ¡°Lord God who drowned for us,¡± the priest prayed, in a voice as deep as the sea, ¡°let Emmond your servant be reborn from the sea, as you were. Bless him with salt, bless him with stone, bless him with steel.¡± 
¡¡¡¡Finally, it was done. No more air was bubbling from his mouth, and all the strength had gone out of his limbs. Facedown in the shallow sea floated Emmond, pale and cold and peaceful. 
¡¡¡¡That was when the Damphair realized that three horsemen had joined his drowned men on the pebbled shore. Aeron knew the Sparr, a hatchet-faced old man with watery eyes whose quavery voice was law on this part of Great Wyk. His son Steffarion accompanied him, with another youth whose dark red fur-lined cloak was pinned at the shoulder with an ornate brooch that showed the black-and-gold warhorn of the Goodbrothers. One of Gorold¡¯s sons, the priest decided at a glance. Three tall sons had been born to Goodbrother¡¯s wife late in life, after a dozen daughters, and it was said that no man could tell one son from the others. Aeron Damphair did not deign to try. Whether this be Greydon or Gormond or Gran, the priest had no time for him. 
¡¡¡¡He growled a brusque command, and his drowned men seized the dead boy by his arms and legs to carry him above the tideline. The priest followed, naked but for a sealskin clout that covered his private parts. Goosefleshed and dripping, he splashed back onto land, across cold wet sand and sea-scoured pebbles. One of his drowned men handed him a robe of heavy roughspun dyed in mottled greens and blues and greys, the colors of the sea and the Drowned God. Aeron donned the robe and pulled his hair free. Black and wet, that hair; no blade had touched it since the sea had raised him up. It draped his shoulders like a ragged, ropy cloak, and fell down past his waist. Aeron wove strands of seaweed through it, and through his tangled, uncut beard. 
¡¡¡¡His drowned men formed a circle around the dead boy, praying. Norjen worked his arms whilst Rus knelt astride him, pumping on his chest, but all moved aside for Aeron. He pried apart the boy¡¯s cold lips with his fingers and gave Emmond the kiss of life, and again, and again, until the sea came gushing from his mouth. The boy began to cough and spit, and his eyes blinked open, full of fear. 
¡¡¡¡Another one returned. It was a sign of the Drowned God¡¯s favor, men said. Every other priest lost a man from time to time, even Tarle the Thrice-Drowned, who had once been thought so holy that he was picked to crown a king. But never Aeron Greyjoy. He was the Damphair, who had seen the god¡¯s own watery halls and returned to tell of it. ¡°Rise,¡± he told the sputtering boy as he slapped him on his naked back. ¡°You have drowned and been returned to us. What is dead can never die.¡± ¡°But rises.¡± The boy coughed violently, bringing up more water. ¡°Rises again.¡± Every word was bought with pain, but that was the way of the world; a man must fight to live. ¡°Rises again.¡± Emmond staggered to his feet. ¡°Harder. And stronger.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°You belong to the god now,¡± Aeron told him. The other drowned men gathered round and each gave him a punch and a kiss to welcome him to the brotherhood. One helped him don a roughspun robe of mottled blue and green and grey. Another presented him with a driftwood cudgel. ¡°You belong to the sea now, so the sea has armed you,¡± Aeron said. ¡°We pray that you shall wield your cudgel fiercely, against all the enemies of our god.¡± 
¡¡¡¡Only then did the priest turn to the three riders, watching from their saddles. ¡°Have you come to be drowned, my lords?¡± 
¡¡¡¡The Sparr coughed. ¡°I was drowned as a boy,¡± he said, ¡°and my son upon his name day.¡± 
¡¡¡¡Aeron snorted. That Steffarion Sparr had been given to the Drowned God soon after birth he had no doubt. He knew the manner of it too, a quick dip into a tub of seawater that scarce wet the infant¡¯s head. Small wonder the ironborn had been conquered, they who once held sway everywhere the sound of waves was heard. ¡°That is no true drowning,¡± he told the riders. ¡°He that does not die in truth cannot hope to rise from death. Why have you come, if not to prove your faith?¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Lord Gorold¡¯s son came seeking you, with news.¡± The Sparr indicated the youth in the red cloak. 
¡¡¡¡The boy looked to be no more than six-and-ten. ¡°Aye, and which are you?¡± Aeron demanded. 
¡¡¡¡¡°Gormond. Gormond Goodbrother, if it please my lord.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°It is the Drowned God we must please. Have you been drowned, Gormond Goodbrother?¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°On my name day, Damphair. My father sent me to find you and bring you to him. He needs to see you.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Here I stand. Let Lord Gorold come and feast his eyes.¡± Aeron took a leather skin from Rus, freshly filled with water from the sea. The priest pulled out the cork and took a swallow. 
¡¡¡¡¡°I am to bring you to the keep,¡± insisted young Gormond, from atop his horse. 
¡¡¡¡He is afraid to dismount, lest he get his boots wet. ¡°I have the god¡¯s work to do.¡± Aeron Greyjoy was a prophet. He did not suffer petty lords ordering him about like some thrall. ¡°Gorold¡¯s had a bird,¡± said the Sparr. 
¡¡¡¡¡°A maester¡¯s bird, from Pyke,¡± Gormond confirmed. 
¡¡¡¡Dark wings, dark words. ¡°The ravens fly o¡¯er salt and stone. If there are tidings that concern me, speak them now.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Such tidings as we bear are for your ears alone, Damphair,¡± the Sparr said. ¡°These are not matters I would speak of here before these others.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°These others are my drowned men, god¡¯s servants, just as I am. I have no secrets from them, nor from our god, beside whose holy sea I stand.¡± 
¡¡¡¡The horsemen exchanged a look. ¡°Tell him,¡± said the Sparr, and the youth in the red cloak summoned up his courage. ¡°The king is dead,¡± he said, as plain as that. Four small words, yet the sea itself trembled when he uttered them. 
¡¡¡¡Four kings there were in Westeros, yet Aeron did not need to ask which one was meant. Balon Greyjoy ruled the Iron Islands, and no other. The king is dead. How can that be? Aeron had seen his eldest brother not a moon¡¯s turn past, when he had returned to the Iron Islands from harrying the Stony Shore. Balon¡¯s grey hair had gone half-white whilst the priest had been away, and the stoop in his shoulders was more pronounced than when the longships sailed. Yet all in all the king had not seemed ill. 
¡¡¡¡Aeron Greyjoy had built his life upon two mighty pillars. Those four small words had knocked one down. Only the Drowned God remains to me. May he make me as strong and tireless as the sea. ¡°Tell me the manner of my brother¡¯s death.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°His Grace was crossing a bridge at Pyke when he fell and was dashed upon the rocks below.¡± 
¡¡¡¡The Greyjoy stronghold stood upon a broken headland, its keeps and towers built atop massive stone stacks that thrust up from the sea. Bridges knotted Pyke together; arched bridges of carved stone and swaying spans of hempen rope and wooden planks. ¡°Was the storm raging when he fell?¡± Aeron demanded of them. 
¡¡¡¡¡°Aye,¡± the youth said, ¡°it was.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°The Storm God cast him down,¡± the priest announced. For a thousand thousand years sea and sky had been at war. From the sea had come the ironborn, and the fish that sustained them even in the depths of winter, but storms brought only woe and grief. ¡°My brother Balon made us great again, which earned the Storm God¡¯s wrath. He feasts now in the Drowned God¡¯s watery halls, with mermaids to attend his every want. It shall be for us who remain behind in this dry and dismal vale to finish his great work.¡± He pushed the cork back into his waterskin. ¡°I shall speak with your lord father. How far from here to Hammerhorn?¡± ¡°Six leagues. You may ride pillion with me.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°One can ride faster than two. Give me your horse, and the Drowned God will bless you.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Take my horse, Damphair,¡± offered Steffarion Sparr. 
¡¡¡¡¡°No. His mount is stronger. Your horse, boy.¡± 
¡¡¡¡The youth hesitated half a heartbeat, then dismounted and held the reins for the Damphair. Aeron shoved a bare black foot into a stirrup and swung himself onto the saddle. He was not fond of horses¡ªthey were creatures from the green lands and helped to make men weak¡ªbut necessity required that he ride. Dark wings, dark words. A storm was brewing, he could hear it in the waves, and storms brought naught but evil. ¡°Meet with me at Pebbleton beneath Lord Merlyn¡¯s tower,¡± he told his drowned men, as he turned the horse¡¯s head. 
¡¡¡¡The way was rough, up hills and woods and stony defiles, along a narrow track that oft seemed to disappear beneath the horse¡¯s hooves. Great Wyk was the largest of the Iron Islands, so vast that some of its lords had holdings that did not front upon the holy sea. Gorold Goodbrother was one such. His keep was in the Hardstone Hills, as far from the Drowned God¡¯s realm as any place in the isles. Gorold¡¯s folk toiled down in Gorold¡¯s mines, in the stony dark beneath the earth. Some lived and died without setting eyes upon salt water. Small wonder that such folk are crabbed and queer. 
¡¡¡¡As Aeron rode, his thoughts turned to his brothers. 
¡¡¡¡Nine sons had been born from the loins of Quellon Greyjoy, the Lord of the Iron Islands. Harlon, Quenton, and Donel had been born of Lord Quellon¡¯s first wife, a woman of the Stonetrees. Balon, Euron, Victarion, Urrigon, and Aeron were the sons of his second, a Sunderly of Saltcliffe. For a third wife Quellon took a girl from the green lands, who gave him a sickly idiot boy named Robin, the brother best forgotten. The priest had no memory of Quenton or Donel, who had died as infants. Harlon he recalled but dimly, sitting grey-faced and still in a windowless tower room and speaking in whispers that grew fainter every day as the greyscale turned his tongue and lips to stone. One day we shall feast on fish together in the Drowned God¡¯s watery halls, the four of us and Urri too. 
¡¡¡¡Nine sons had been born from the loins of Quellon Greyjoy, but only four had lived to manhood. That was the way of this cold world, where men fished the sea and dug in the ground and died, whilst women brought forth short-lived children from beds of blood and pain. Aeron had been the last and least of the four krakens, Balon the eldest and boldest, a fierce and fearless boy who lived only to restore the ironborn to their ancient glory. At ten he scaled the Flint Cliffs to the Blind Lord¡¯s haunted tower. At thirteen he could run a longship¡¯s oars and dance the finger dance as well as any man in the isles. At fifteen he had sailed with Dagmer Cleftjaw to the Stepstones and spent a summer reaving. He slew his first man there and took his first two salt wives. At seventeen Balon captained his own ship. He was all that an elder brother ought to be, though he had never shown Aeron aught but scorn. I was weak and full of sin, and scorn was more than I deserved. Better to be scorned by Balon the Brave than beloved of Euron Crow¡¯s Eye. And if age and grief had turned Balon bitter with the years, they had also made him more determined than any man alive. He was born a lord¡¯s son and died a king, murdered by a jealous god, Aeron thought, and now the storm is coming, a storm such as these isles have never known. 
¡¡¡¡It was long after dark by the time the priest espied the spiky iron battlements of the Hammerhorn clawing at the crescent moon. Gorold¡¯s keep was hulking and blocky, its great stones quarried from the cliff that loomed behind it. Below its walls, the entrances of caves and ancient mines yawned like toothless black mouths. The Hammerhorn¡¯s iron gates had been closed and barred for the night. Aeron beat on them with a rock until the clanging woke a guard. 
¡¡¡¡The youth who admitted him was the image of Gormond, whose horse he¡¯d taken. ¡°Which one are you?¡± Aeron demanded. 
¡¡¡¡¡°Gran. My father awaits you within.¡± 
¡¡¡¡The hall was dank and drafty, full of shadows. One of Gorold¡¯s daughters offered the priest a horn of ale. Another poked at a sullen fire that was giving off more smoke than heat. Gorold Goodbrother himself was talking quietly with a slim man in fine grey robes, who wore about his neck a chain of many metals that marked him for a maester of the Citadel. 
¡¡¡¡¡°Where is Gormond?¡± Gorold asked when he saw Aeron. 
¡¡¡¡¡°He returns afoot. Send your women away, my lord. And the maester as well.¡± He had no love of maesters. Their ravens were creatures of the Storm God, and he did not trust their healing, not since Urri. No proper man would choose a life of thralldom, nor forge a chain of servitude to wear about his throat. 
¡¡¡¡¡°Gysella, Gwin, leave us,¡± Goodbrother said curtly. ¡°You as well, Gran. Maester Murenmure will stay.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°He will go,¡± insisted Aeron. 
¡¡¡¡¡°This is my hall, Damphair. It is not for you to say who must go and who remains. The maester stays.¡± 
¡¡¡¡The man lives too far from the sea, Aeron told himself. ¡°Then I shall go,¡± he told Goodbrother. Dry rushes rustled underneath the cracked soles of his bare black feet as he turned and stalked away. It seemed he had ridden a long way for naught. Aeron was almost at the door when the maester cleared his throat, and said, ¡°Euron Crow¡¯s Eye sits the Seastone Chair.¡± 
¡¡¡¡The Damphair turned. The hall had suddenly grown colder. The Crow¡¯s Eye is half a world away. Balon sent him off two years ago, and swore that it would be his life if he returned. ¡°Tell me,¡± he said hoarsely. 
¡¡¡¡¡°He sailed into Lordsport the day after the king¡¯s death, and claimed the castle and the crown as Balon¡¯s eldest brother,¡± said Gorold Goodbrother. ¡°Now he sends forth ravens, summoning the captains and the kings from every isle to Pyke, to bend their knees and do him homage as their king.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°No.¡± Aeron Damphair did not weigh his words. ¡°Only a godly man may sit the Seastone Chair. The Crow¡¯s Eye worships naught but his own pride.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°You were on Pyke not long ago, and saw the king,¡± said Goodbrother. ¡°Did Balon say aught to you of the succession?¡± 
¡¡¡¡Aye. They had spoken in the Sea Tower, as the wind howled outside the windows and the waves crashed restlessly below. Balon had shaken his head in despair when he heard what Aeron had to tell him of his last remaining son. ¡°The wolves have made a weakling of him, as I feared,¡± the king had said. ¡°I pray god that they killed him, so he cannot stand in Asha¡¯s way.¡± That was Balon¡¯s blindness; he saw himself in his wild, headstrong daughter, and believed she could succeed him. He was wrong in that, and Aeron tried to tell him so. ¡°No woman will ever rule the ironborn, not even a woman such as Asha,¡± he insisted, but Balon could be deaf to things he did not wish to hear. 
¡¡¡¡Before the priest could answer Gorold Goodbrother, the maester¡¯s mouth flapped open once again. ¡°By rights the Seastone Chair belongs to Theon, or Asha if the prince is dead. That is the law.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Green land law,¡± said Aeron with contempt. ¡°What is that to us? We are ironborn, the sons of the sea, chosen of the Drowned God. No woman may rule over us, nor any godless man.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°And Victarion?¡± asked Gorold Goodbrother. ¡°He has the Iron Fleet. Will Victarion make a claim, Damphair?¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Euron is the elder brother . . .¡± began the maester. 
¡¡¡¡Aeron silenced him with a look. In little fishing towns and great stone keeps alike such a look from Damphair would make maids feel faint and send children shrieking to their mothers, and it was more than sufficient to quell the chain-neck thrall. ¡°Euron is elder,¡± the priest said, ¡°but Victarion is more godly.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Will it come to war between them?¡± asked the maester. ¡°Ironborn must not spill the blood of ironborn.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°A pious sentiment, Damphair,¡± said Goodbrother, ¡°but not one that your brother shares. He had Sawane Botley drowned for saying that the Seastone Chair by rights belonged to Theon.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°If he was drowned, no blood was shed,¡± said Aeron. 
¡¡¡¡The maester and the lord exchanged a look. ¡°I must send word to Pyke, and soon,¡± said Gorold Goodbrother. ¡°Damphair, I would have your counsel. What shall it be, homage or defiance?¡± 
¡¡¡¡Aeron tugged his beard, and thought. I have seen the storm, and its name is Euron Crow¡¯s Eye. ¡°For now, send only silence,¡± he told the lord. ¡°I must pray on this.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Pray all you wish,¡± the maester said. ¡°It does not change the law. Theon is the rightful heir, and Asha next.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Silence!¡± Aeron roared. ¡°Too long have the ironborn listened to you chain-neck maesters prating of the green lands and their laws. It is time we listened to the sea again. It is time we listened to the voice of god.¡± His own voice rang in that smoky hall, so full of power that neither Gorold Goodbrother nor his maester dared a reply. The Drowned God is with me, Aeron thought. He has shown me the way. 
¡¡¡¡Goodbrother offered him the comforts of the castle for the night, but the priest declined. He seldom slept beneath a castle roof, and never so far from the sea. ¡°Comforts I shall know in the Drowned God¡¯s watery halls beneath the waves. We are born to suffer, that our sufferings might make us strong. All that I require is a fresh horse to carry me to Pebbleton.¡± 
¡¡¡¡That Goodbrother was pleased to provide. He sent his son Greydon as well, to show the priest the shortest way through the hills down to the sea. Dawn was still an hour off when they set forth, but their mounts were hardy and surefooted, and they made good time despite the darkness. Aeron closed his eyes and said a silent prayer, and after a while began to drowse in the saddle. 
¡¡¡¡The sound came softly, the scream of a rusted hinge. ¡°Urri,¡± he muttered, and woke, fearful. There is no hinge here, no door, no Urri. A flying axe took off half of Urri¡¯s hand when he was ten-and-four, playing at the finger dance whilst his father and his elder brothers were away at war. Lord Quellon¡¯s third wife had been a Piper of Pinkmaiden Castle, a girl with big soft breasts and brown doe¡¯s eyes. Instead of healing Urri¡¯s hand the Old Way, with fire and seawater, she gave him to her green land maester, who swore that he could sew back the missing fingers. He did that, and later he used potions and poltices and herbs, but the hand mortified and Urri took a fever. By the time the maester sawed his arm off, it was too late. Lord Quellon never returned from his last voyage; the Drowned God in his goodness granted him a death at sea. It was Lord Balon who came back, with his brothers Euron and Victarion. When Balon heard what had befallen Urri, he removed three of the maester¡¯s fingers with a cook¡¯s cleaver and sent his father¡¯s Piper wife to sew them back on. Poltices and potions worked as well for the maester as they had for Urrigon. He died raving, and Lord Quellon¡¯s third wife followed soon thereafter, as the midwife drew a stillborn daughter from her womb. Aeron had been glad. It had been his axe that sheared off Urri¡¯s hand, whilst they danced the finger dance together, as friends and brothers will. 
¡¡¡¡It shamed him still to recall the years that followed Urri¡¯s death. At six-and-ten he called himself a man, but in truth he had been a sack of wine with legs. He would sing, he would dance (but not the finger dance, never again), he would jape and jabber and make mock. He played the pipes, he juggled, he rode horses, and could drink more than all the Wynches and the Botleys, and half the Harlaws too. The Drowned God gives every man a gift, even him; no man could piss longer or farther than Aeron Greyjoy, as he proved at every feast. Once he bet his new longship against a herd of goats that he could quench a hearthfire with no more than his cock. Aeron feasted on goat for a year, and named the longship Golden Storm, though Balon threatened to hang him from her mast when he heard what sort of ram his brother proposed to mount upon her prow. 
¡¡¡¡In the end the Golden Storm went down off Fair Isle during Balon¡¯s first rebellion, cut in half by a towering war galley called Fury when Stannis Baratheon caught Victarion in his trap and smashed the Iron Fleet. Yet the god was not done with Aeron, and carried him to shore. Some fishermen took him captive and marched him down to Lannisport in chains, and he spent the rest of the war in the bowels of Casterly Rock, proving that krakens can piss farther and longer than lions, boars, or chickens. 
¡¡¡¡That man is dead. Aeron had drowned and been reborn from the sea, the god¡¯s own prophet. No mortal man could frighten him, no more than the darkness could . . . nor memories, the bones of the soul. The sound of a door opening, the scream of a rusted iron hinge. Euron has come again. It did not matter. He was the Damphair priest, beloved of the god. 
¡¡¡¡¡°Will it come to war?¡± asked Greydon Goodbrother as the sun was lightening the hills. ¡°A war of brother against brother?¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°If the Drowned God wills it. No godless man may sit the Seastone Chair.¡± The Crow¡¯s Eye will fight, that is certain. No woman could defeat him, not even Asha; women were made to fight their battles in the birthing bed. And Theon, if he lived, was just as hopeless, a boy of sulks and smiles. At Winterfell he proved his worth, such that it was, but the Crow¡¯s Eye was no crippled boy. The decks of Euron¡¯s ship were painted red, to better hide the blood that soaked them. Victarion. The king must be Victarion, or the storm will slay us all. 
¡¡¡¡Greydon left him when the sun was up, to take the news of Balon¡¯s death to his cousins in their towers at Downdelving, Crow Spike Keep, and Corpse Lake. Aeron continued on alone, up hills and down vales along a stony track that drew wider and more traveled as he neared the sea. In every village he paused to preach, and in the yards of petty lords as well. ¡°We were born from the sea, and to the sea we all return,¡± he told them. His voice was as deep as the ocean, and thundered like the waves. ¡°The Storm God in his wrath plucked Balon from his castle and cast him down, and now he feasts beneath the waves in the Drowned God¡¯s watery halls.¡± He raised his hands. ¡°Balon is dead! The king is dead! Yet a king will come again! For what is dead may never die, but rises again, harder and stronger! A king will rise!¡± 
¡¡¡¡Some of those who heard him threw down their hoes and picks to follow, so by the time he heard the crash of waves a dozen men walked behind his horse, touched by god and desirous of drowning. 
¡¡¡¡Pebbleton was home to several thousand fisherfolk, whose hovels huddled round the base of a square towerhouse with a turret at each corner. Twoscore of Aeron¡¯s drowned men there awaited him, camped along a grey sand beach in sealskin tents and shelters built of driftwood. Their hands were roughened by brine, scarred by nets and lines, callused from oars and picks and axes, but now those hands gripped driftwood cudgels hard as iron, for the god had armed them from his arsenal beneath the sea. 
¡¡¡¡They had built a shelter for the priest just above the tideline. Gladly he crawled into it, after he had drowned his newest followers. My god, he prayed, speak to me in the rumble of the waves, and tell me what to do. The captains and the kings await your word. Who shall be our king in Balon¡¯s place? Sing to me in the language of leviathan, that I may know his name. Tell me, O Lord beneath the waves, who has the strength to fight the storm on Pyke? 
¡¡¡¡Though his ride to Hammerhorn had left him weary, Aeron Damphair was restless in his driftwood shelter, roofed over with black weeds from the sea. The clouds rolled in to cloak the moon and stars, and the darkness lay as thick upon the sea as it did upon his soul. Balon favored Asha, the child of his body, but a woman cannot rule the ironborn. It must be Victarion. Nine sons had been born from the loins of Quellon Greyjoy, and Victarion was the strongest of them, a bull of a man, fearless and dutiful. And therein lies our danger. A younger brother owes obedience to an elder, and Victarion was not a man to sail against tradition. He has no love for Euron, though. Not since the woman died. 
¡¡¡¡Outside, beneath the snoring of his drowned men and the keening of the wind, he could hear the pounding of the waves, the hammer of his god calling him to battle. Aeron crept from his little shelter into the chill of the night. Naked he stood, pale and gaunt and tall, and naked he walked into the black salt sea. The water was icy cold, yet he did not flinch from his god¡¯s caress. A wave smashed against his chest, staggering him. The next broke over his head. He could taste the salt on his lips and feel the god around him, and his ears rang with the glory of his song. Nine sons were born from the loins of Quellon Greyjoy, and I was the least of them, as weak and frightened as a girl. But no longer. That man is drowned, and the god has made me strong. The cold salt sea surrounded him, embraced him, reached down through his weak man¡¯s flesh and touched his bones. Bones, he thought. The bones of the soul. Balon¡¯s bones, and Urri¡¯s. The truth is in our bones, for flesh decays and bone endures. And on the hill of Nagga, the bones of the Grey King¡¯s Hall . . . 
¡¡¡¡And gaunt and pale and shivering, Aeron Damphair struggled back to the shore, a wiser man than he had been when he stepped into the sea. For he had found the answer in his bones, and the way was plain before him. The night was so cold that his body seemed to steam as he stalked back toward his shelter, but there was a fire burning in his heart, and sleep came easily for once, unbroken by the scream of iron hinges. 
¡¡¡¡When he woke the day was bright and windy. Aeron broke his fast on a broth of clams and seaweed cooked above a driftwood fire. No sooner had he finished than the Merlyn descended from his towerhouse with half a dozen guards to seek him out. ¡°The king is dead,¡± the Damphair told him. 
¡¡¡¡¡°Aye. I had a bird. And now another.¡± The Merlyn was a bald round fleshy man who styled himself ¡°Lord¡± in the manner of the green lands, and dressed in furs and velvets. ¡°One raven summons me to Pyke, another to Ten Towers. You krakens have too many arms, you pull a man to pieces. What say you, priest? Where should I send my longships?¡± 
¡¡¡¡Aeron scowled. ¡°Ten Towers, do you say? What kraken calls you there?¡± Ten Towers was the seat of the Lord of Harlaw. 
¡¡¡¡¡°The Princess Asha. She has set her sails for home. The Reader sends out ravens, summoning all her friends to Harlaw. He says that Balon meant for her to sit the Seastone Chair.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°The Drowned God shall decide who sits the Seastone Chair,¡± the priest said. ¡°Kneel, that I might bless you.¡± Lord Merlyn sank to his knees, and Aeron uncorked his skin and poured a stream of seawater on his bald pate. ¡°Lord God who drowned for us, let Meldred your servant be born again from the sea. Bless him with salt, bless him with stone, bless him with steel.¡± Water ran down Merlyn¡¯s fat cheeks to soak his beard and fox-fur mantle. ¡°What is dead may never die,¡± Aeron finished, ¡°but rises again, harder and stronger.¡± But when Merlyn rose, he told him, ¡°Stay and listen, that you may spread god¡¯s word.¡± 
¡¡¡¡Three feet from the water¡¯s edge the waves broke around a rounded granite boulder. It was there that Aeron Damphair stood, so all his school might see him, and hear the words he had to say. 
¡¡¡¡¡°We were born from the sea, and to the sea we all return,¡± he began, as he had a hundred times before. ¡°The Storm God in his wrath plucked Balon from his castle and cast him down, and now he feasts beneath the waves.¡± He raised his hands. ¡°The iron king is dead! Yet a king will come again! For what is dead may never die, but rises again, harder and stronger!¡± ¡°A king shall rise!¡± the drowned men cried. 
¡¡¡¡¡°He shall. He must. But who?¡± The Damphair listened a moment, but only the waves gave answer. ¡°Who shall be our king?¡± 
¡¡¡¡The drowned men began to slam their driftwood cudgels one against the other. ¡°Damphair!¡± they cried. ¡°Damphair King! Aeron King! Give us Damphair!¡± 
¡¡¡¡Aeron shook his head. ¡°If a father has two sons and gives to one an axe and to the other a net, which does he intend should be the warrior?¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°The axe is for the warrior,¡± Rus shouted back, ¡°the net for a fisher of the seas.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Aye,¡± said Aeron. ¡°The god took me deep beneath the waves and drowned the worthless thing I was. When he cast me forth again he gave me eyes to see, ears to hear, and a voice to spread his word, that I might be his prophet and teach his truth to those who have forgotten. I was not made to sit upon the Seastone Chair . . . no more than Euron Crow¡¯s Eye. For I have heard the god, who says, No godless man may sit my Seastone Chair!¡± 
¡¡¡¡The Merlyn crossed his arms against his chest. ¡°Is it Asha, then? Or Victarion? Tell us, priest!¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°The Drowned God will tell you, but not here.¡± Aeron pointed at the Merlyn¡¯s fat white face. ¡°Look not to me, nor to the laws of men, but to the sea. Raise your sails and unship your oars, my lord, and take yourself to Old Wyk. You, and all the captains and the kings. Go not to Pyke, to bow before the godless, nor to Harlaw, to consort with scheming women. Point your prow toward Old Wyk, where stood the Grey King¡¯s Hall. In the name of the Drowned God I summon you. I summon all of you! Leave your halls and hovels, your castles and your keeps, and return to Nagga¡¯s hill to make a kingsmoot!¡± 
¡¡¡¡The Merlyn gaped at him. ¡°A kingsmoot? There has not been a true kingsmoot in . . .¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°. . . too long a time!¡± Aeron cried in anguish. ¡°Yet in the dawn of days the ironborn chose their own kings, raising up the worthiest amongst them. It is time we returned to the Old Way, for only that shall make us great again. It was a kingsmoot that chose Urras Ironfoot for High King, and placed a driftwood crown upon his brows. Sylas Flatnose, Harrag Hoare, the Old Kraken, the kingsmoot raised them all. And from this kingsmoot shall emerge a man to finish the work King Balon has begun and win us back our freedoms. Go not to Pyke, nor to the Ten Towers of Harlaw, but to Old Wyk, I say again. Seek the hill of Nagga and the bones of the Grey King¡¯s Hall, for in that holy place when the moon has drowned and come again we shall make ourselves a worthy king, a godly king.¡± He raised his bony hands on high again. ¡°Listen! Listen to the waves! Listen to the god! He is speaking to us, and he says, We shall have no king but from the kingsmoot!¡± 
¡¡¡¡A roar went up at that, and the drowned men beat their cudgels one against the other. ¡°A kingsmoot!¡± they shouted. ¡°A kingsmoot, a kingsmoot. No king but from the kingsmoot!¡± And the clamor that they made was so thunderous that surely the Crow¡¯s Eye heard the shouts on Pyke, and the vile Storm God in his cloudy hall. And Aeron Damphair knew he had done well. 
¡¡¡¡
    THE CAPTAIN OF GUARDS 
¡¡¡¡The blood oranges are well past ripe,¡± the prince observed in a weary voice, when the captain rolled him onto the terrace. 
¡¡¡¡After that he did not speak again for hours. 
¡¡¡¡It was true about the oranges. A few had fallen to burst open on the pale pink marble. The sharp sweet smell of them filled Hotah¡¯s nostrils each time he took a breath. No doubt the prince could smell them too, as he sat beneath the trees in the rolling chair Maester Caleotte had made for him, with its goose-down cushions and rumbling wheels of ebony and iron. 
¡¡¡¡For a long while the only sounds were the children splashing in the pools and fountains, and once a soft plop as another orange dropped onto the terrace to burst. Then, from the far side of the palace, the captain heard the faint drumbeat of boots on marble. 
¡¡¡¡Obara. He knew her stride; long-legged, hasty, angry. In the stables by the gates, her horse would be lathered, and bloody from her spurs. She always rode stallions, and had been heard to boast that she could master any horse in Dorne . . . and any man as well. The captain could hear other footsteps as well, the quick soft scuffing of Maester Caleotte hurrying to keep up. 
¡¡¡¡Obara Sand always walked too fast. She is chasing after something she can never catch, the prince had told his daughter once, in the captain¡¯s hearing. 
¡¡¡¡When she appeared beneath the triple arch, Areo Hotah swung his longaxe sideways to block the way. The head was on a shaft of mountain ash six feet long, so she could not go around. ¡°My lady, no farther.¡± His voice was a bass grumble thick with the accents of Norvos. ¡°The prince does not wish to be disturbed.¡± 
¡¡¡¡Her face had been stone before he spoke; then it hardened. ¡°You are in my way, Hotah.¡± Obara was the eldest Sand Snake, a big-boned woman near to thirty, with the close-set eyes and rat-brown hair of the Oldtown whore who¡¯d birthed her. Beneath a mottled sandsilk cloak of dun and gold, her riding clothes were old brown leather, worn and supple. They were the softest things about her. On one hip she wore a coiled whip, across her back a round shield of steel and copper. She had left her spear outside. For that, Areo Hotah gave thanks. Quick and strong as she was, the woman was no match for him, he knew . . . but she did not, and he had no wish to see her blood upon the pale pink marble. 
¡¡¡¡Maester Caleotte shifted his weight from foot to foot. ¡°Lady Obara, I tried to tell you . . .¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Does he know that my father is dead?¡± Obara asked the captain, paying the maester no more mind than she would a fly, if any fly had been foolish enough to buzz about her head. 
¡¡¡¡¡°He does,¡± the captain said. ¡°He had a bird.¡± 
¡¡¡¡Death had come to Dorne on raven wings, writ small and sealed with a blob of hard red wax. Caleotte must have sensed what was in that letter, for he¡¯d given it Hotah to deliver. The prince thanked him, but for the longest time he would not break the seal. All afternoon he¡¯d sat with the parchment in his lap, watching the children at their play. He watched until the sun went down and the evening air grew cool enough to drive them inside; then he watched the starlight on the water. It was moonrise before he sent Hotah to fetch a candle, so he might read his letter beneath the orange trees in the dark of night. 
¡¡¡¡Obara touched her whip. ¡°Thousands are crossing the sands afoot to climb the Boneway, so they may help Ellaria bring my father home. The septs are packed to bursting, and the red priests have lit their temple fires. In the pillow houses women are coupling with every man who comes to them, and refusing any coin. In Sunspear, on the Broken Arm, along the Greenblood, in the mountains, out in the deep sand, everywhere, everywhere, women tear their hair and men cry out in rage. The same question is heard on every tongue¡ª what will Doran do? What will his brother do to avenge our murdered prince?¡± She moved closer to the captain. ¡°And you say, he does not wish to be disturbed!¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°He does not wish to be disturbed,¡± Areo Hotah said again. 
¡¡¡¡The captain of guards knew the prince he guarded. Once, long ago, a callow youth had come from Norvos, a big broad-shouldered boy with a mop of dark hair. That hair was white now, and his body bore the scars of many battles . . . but his strength remained, and he kept his longaxe sharp, as the bearded priests had taught him. She shall not pass, he told himself, and said, ¡°The prince is watching the children at their play. He is never to be disturbed when he is watching the children at their play.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Hotah,¡± said Obara Sand, ¡°you will remove yourself from my path, else I shall take that longaxe and¡ª¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Captain,¡± came the command, from behind. ¡°Let her pass. I will speak with her.¡± The prince¡¯s voice was hoarse. Areo Hotah jerked his longaxe upright and stepped to one side. Obara gave him a lingering last look and strode past, the maester hurrying at her heels. Caleotte was no more than five feet tall and bald as an egg. His face was so smooth and fat that it was hard to tell his age, but he had been here before the captain, had even served the prince¡¯s mother. Despite his age and girth, he was still nimble enough, and clever as they came, but meek. He is no match for any Sand Snake, the captain thought. 
¡¡¡¡In the shade of the orange trees, the prince sat in his chair with his gouty legs propped up before him, and heavy bags beneath his eyes . . . though whether it was grief or gout that kept him sleepless, Hotah could not say. Below, in the fountains and the pools, the children were still at their play. The youngest were no more than five, the oldest nine and ten. Half were girls and half were boys. Hotah could hear them splashing and shouting at each other in high, shrill voices. ¡°It was not so long ago that you were one of the children in those pools, Obara,¡± the prince said, when she took one knee before his rolling chair. 
¡¡¡¡She snorted. ¡°It has been twenty years, or near enough to make no matter. And I was not here long. I am the whore¡¯s whelp, or had you forgotten?¡± When he did not answer, she rose again and put her hands upon her hips. ¡°My father has been murdered.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°He was slain in single combat during a trial by battle,¡± Prince Doran said. ¡°By law, that is no murder.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°He was your brother.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°He was.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°What do you mean to do about his death?¡± 
¡¡¡¡The prince turned his chair laboriously to face her. Though he was but two-and-fifty, Doran Martell seemed much older. His body was soft and shapeless beneath his linen robes, and his legs were hard to look upon. The gout had swollen and reddened his joints grotesquely; his left knee was an apple, his right a melon, and his toes had turned to dark red grapes, so ripe it seemed as though a touch would burst them. Even the weight of a coverlet could make him shudder, though he bore the pain without complaint. Silence is a prince¡¯s friend, the captain had heard him tell his daughter once. Words are like arrows, Arianne. Once loosed, you cannot call them back. ¡°I have written to Lord Tywin¡ª¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Written? If you were half the man my father was¡ª¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°I am not your father.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°That I knew.¡± Obara¡¯s voice was thick with contempt. 
¡¡¡¡¡°You would have me go to war.¡± ¡°I know better. You need not even leave your chair. Let me avenge my father. You have a host in the Prince¡¯s Pass. Lord Yronwood has another in the Boneway. Grant me the one and Nym the other. Let her ride the kingsroad, whilst I turn the marcher lords out of their castles and hook round to march on Oldtown.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°And how could you hope to hold Oldtown?¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°It will be enough to sack it. The wealth of Hightower¡ª¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Is it gold you want?¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°It is blood I want.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Lord Tywin shall deliver us the Mountain¡¯s head.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°And who will deliver us Lord Tywin¡¯s head? The Mountain has always been his pet.¡± 
¡¡¡¡The prince gestured toward the pools. ¡°Obara, look at the children, if it please you.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°It does not please me. I¡¯d get more pleasure from driving my spear into Lord Tywin¡¯s belly. I¡¯ll make him sing ¡®The Rains of Castamere¡¯ as I pull his bowels out and look for gold.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Look,¡± the prince repeated. ¡°I command you.¡± 
¡¡¡¡A few of the older children lay facedown upon the smooth pink marble, browning in the sun. Others paddled in the sea beyond. Three were building a sand castle with a great spike that resembled the Spear Tower of the Old Palace. A score or more had gathered in the big pool, to watch the battles as smaller children rode through the waist-deep shallows on the shoulders of the larger and tried to shove each other into the water. Every time a pair went down, the splash was followed by a roar of laughter. They watched a nut-brown girl yank a towheaded boy off his brother¡¯s shoulders to tumble him headfirst into the pool. 
¡¡¡¡¡°Your father played that same game once, as I did before him,¡± said the prince. ¡°We had ten years between us, so I had left the pools by the time he was old enough to play, but I would watch him when I came to visit Mother. He was so fierce, even as a boy. Quick as a water snake. I oft saw him topple boys much bigger than himself. He reminded me of that the day he left for King¡¯s Landing. He swore that he would do it one more time, else I would never have let him go.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Let him go?¡± Obara laughed. ¡°As if you could have stopped him. The Red Viper of Dorne went where he would.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°He did. I wish I had some word of comfort to¡ª¡± ¡°I did not come to you for comfort.¡± Her voice was full of scorn. ¡°The day my father came to claim me, my mother did not wish for me to go. ¡®She is a girl,¡¯ she said, ¡®and I do not think that she is yours. I had a thousand other men.¡¯ He tossed his spear at my feet and gave my mother the back of his hand across the face, so she began to weep. ¡®Girl or boy, we fight our battles,¡¯ he said, ¡®but the gods let us choose our weapons.¡¯ He pointed to the spear, then to my mother¡¯s tears, and I picked up the spear. ¡®I told you she was mine,¡¯ my father said, and took me. My mother drank herself to death within the year. They say that she was weeping as she died.¡± Obara edged closer to the prince in his chair. ¡°Let me use the spear; I ask no more.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°It is a deal to ask, Obara. I shall sleep on it.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°You have slept too long already.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°You may be right. I will send word to you at Sunspear.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°So long as the word is war.¡± Obara turned upon her heel and strode off as angrily as she had come, back to the stables for a fresh horse and another headlong gallop down the road. 
¡¡¡¡Maester Caleotte remained behind. ¡°My prince?¡± the little round man asked. ¡°Do your legs hurt?¡± 
¡¡¡¡The prince smiled faintly. ¡°Is the sun hot?¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Shall I fetch a draught for the pain?¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°No. I need my wits about me.¡± 
¡¡¡¡The maester hesitated. ¡°My prince, is it . . . is it prudent to allow Lady Obara to return to Sunspear? She is certain to inflame the common people. They loved your brother well.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°So did we all.¡± He pressed his fingers to his temples. ¡°No. You are right. I must return to Sunspear as well.¡± 
¡¡¡¡The little round man hesitated. ¡°Is that wise?¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Not wise, but necessary. Best send a rider to Ricasso, and have him open my apartments in the Tower of the Sun. Inform my daughter Arianne that I will be there on the morrow.¡± 
¡¡¡¡My little princess. The captain had missed her sorely. 
¡¡¡¡¡°You will be seen,¡± the maester warned. 
¡¡¡¡The captain understood. Two years ago, when they had left Sunspear for the peace and isolation of the Water Gardens, Prince Doran¡¯s gout had not been half so bad. In those days he had still walked, albeit slowly, leaning on a stick and grimacing with every step. The prince did not wish his enemies to know how feeble he had grown, and the Old Palace and its shadow city were full of eyes. Eyes, the captain thought, and steps he cannot climb. He would need to fly to sit atop the Tower of the Sun. 
¡¡¡¡¡°I must be seen. Someone must pour oil on the waters. Dorne must be reminded that it still has a prince.¡± He smiled wanly. ¡°Old and gouty though he is.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°If you return to Sunspear, you will need to give audience to Princess Myrcella,¡± Caleotte said. ¡°Her white knight will be with her . . . and you know he sends letters to his queen.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°I suppose he does.¡± 
¡¡¡¡The white knight. The captain frowned. Ser Arys had come to Dorne to attend his own princess, as Areo Hotah had once come with his. Even their names sounded oddly alike: Areo and Arys. Yet there the likeness ended. The captain had left Norvos and its bearded priests, but Ser Arys Oakheart still served the Iron Throne. Hotah had felt a certain sadness whenever he saw the man in the long snowy cloak, the times the prince had sent him down to Sunspear. One day, he sensed, the two of them would fight; on that day Oakheart would die, with the captain¡¯s longaxe crashing through his skull. He slid his hand along the smooth ashen shaft of his axe and wondered if that day was drawing nigh. 
¡¡¡¡¡°The afternoon is almost done,¡± the prince was saying. ¡°We will wait for morn. See that my litter is ready by first light.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°As you command.¡± Caleotte bobbed a bow. The captain stood aside to let him pass, and listened to his footsteps dwindle. 
¡¡¡¡¡°Captain?¡± The prince¡¯s voice was soft. 
¡¡¡¡Hotah strode forward, one hand wrapped about his longaxe. The ash felt as smooth as a woman¡¯s skin against his palm. When he reached the rolling chair he thumped its butt down hard to announce his presence, but the prince had eyes only for the children. ¡°Did you have brothers, captain?¡± he asked. ¡°Back in Norvos, when you were young? Sisters?¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Both,¡± Hotah said. ¡°Two brothers, three sisters. I was the youngest.¡± The youngest, and unwanted. Another mouth to feed, a big boy who ate too much and soon outgrew his clothes. Small wonder they had sold him to the bearded priests. 
¡¡¡¡¡°I was the oldest,¡± the prince said, ¡°and yet I am the last. After Mors and Olyvar died in their cradles, I gave up hope of brothers. I was nine when Elia came, a squire in service at Salt Shore. When the raven arrived with word that my mother had been brought to bed a month too soon, I was old enough to understand that meant the child would not live. Even when Lord Gargalen told me that I had a sister, I assured him that she must shortly die. Yet she lived, by the Mother¡¯s mercy. And a year later Oberyn arrived, squalling and kicking. I was a man grown when they were playing in these pools. Yet here I sit, and they are gone.¡± 
¡¡¡¡Areo Hotah did not know what to say to that. He was only a captain of guards, and still a stranger to this land and its seven-faced god, even after all these years. Serve. Obey. Protect. He had sworn those vows at six-and-ten, the day he wed his axe. Simple vows for simple men, the bearded priests had said. He had not been trained to counsel grieving princes. 
¡¡¡¡He was still groping for some words to say when another orange fell with a heavy splat, no more than a foot from where the prince was seated. Doran winced at the sound, as if somehow it had hurt him. ¡°Enough,¡± he sighed, ¡°it is enough. Leave me, Areo. Let me watch the children for a few more hours.¡± 
¡¡¡¡When the sun set the air grew cool and the children went inside in search of supper, still the prince remained beneath his orange trees, looking out over the still pools and the sea beyond. A serving man brought him a bowl of purple olives, with flatbread, cheese, and chickpea paste. He ate a bit of it, and drank a cup of the sweet, heavy strongwine that he loved. When it was empty, he filled it once again. Sometimes in the deep black hours of the morning sleep found him in his chair. Only then did the captain roll him down the moonlit gallery, past a row of fluted pillars and through a graceful archway, to a great bed with crisp cool linen sheets in a chamber by the sea. Doran groaned as the captain moved him, but the gods were good and he did not wake. 
¡¡¡¡The captain¡¯s sleeping cell adjoined his prince¡¯s. He sat upon the narrow bed and found his whetstone and oilcloth in their niche, and set to work. Keep your longaxe sharp, the bearded priests had told him, the day they branded him. He always did. 
¡¡¡¡As he honed the axe, Hotah thought of Norvos, the high city on the hill and the low beside the river. He could still recall the sounds of the three bells, the way that Noom¡¯s deep peals set his very bones to shuddering, the proud strong voice of Narrah, sweet Nyel¡¯s silvery laughter. The taste of wintercake filled his mouth again, rich with ginger and pine nuts and bits of cherry, with nahsa to wash it down, fermented goat¡¯s milk served in an iron cup and laced with honey. He saw his mother in her dress with the squirrel collar, the one she wore but once each year, when they went to see the bears dance down the Sinner¡¯s Steps. And he smelled the stench of burning hair as the bearded priest touched the brand to the center of his chest. The pain had been so fierce that he thought his heart might stop, yet Areo Hotah had not flinched. The hair had never grown back over the axe. 
¡¡¡¡Only when both edges were sharp enough to shave with did the captain lay his ash-andiron wife down on the bed. Yawning, he pulled off his soiled clothes, tossed them on the floor, and stretched out on his straw-stuffed mattress. Thinking of the brand had made it itch, so he had to scratch himself before he closed his eyes. I should have gathered up the oranges that fell, he thought, and went to sleep dreaming of the tart sweet taste of them, and the sticky feel of the red juice on his fingers. Dawn came too soon. Outside the stables the smallest of the three horse litters stood ready, the cedarwood litter with the red silk draperies. The captain chose twenty spears to accompany it, out of the thirty who were posted at the Water Gardens; the rest would stay to guard the grounds and children, some of whom were the sons and daughters of great lords and wealthy merchants. 
¡¡¡¡Although the prince had spoken of departing at first light, Areo Hotah knew that he would dawdle. Whilst the maester helped Doran Martell to bathe and bandaged up his swollen joints in linen wraps soaked with soothing lotions, the captain donned a shirt of copper scales as befit his rank, and a billowing cloak of dun-and-yellow sandsilk to keep the sun off the copper. The day promised to be hot, and the captain had long ago discarded the heavy horsehair cape and studded leather tunic he had worn in Norvos, which were like to cook a man in Dorne. He had kept his iron halfhelm, with its crest of sharpened spikes, but now he wore it wrapped in orange silk, weaving the cloth in and around the spikes. Elsewise the sun beating down on the metal would have his head pounding before they saw the palace. 
¡¡¡¡The prince was still not ready to depart. He had decided to break his fast before he went, with a blood orange and a plate of gull¡¯s eggs diced with bits of ham and fiery peppers. Then nought would do but he must say farewell to several of the children who had become especial favorites: the Dalt boy and Lady Blackmont¡¯s brood and the round-faced orphan girl whose father had sold cloth and spices up and down the Greenblood. Doran kept a splendid Myrish blanket over his legs as he spoke with them, to spare the young ones the sight of his swollen, bandaged joints. 
¡¡¡¡It was midday before they got under way; the prince in his litter, Maester Caleotte riding on a donkey, the rest afoot. Five spearmen walked ahead and five behind, with five more flanking the litter to either side. Areo Hotah himself took his familiar place at the left hand of the prince, resting his longaxe on a shoulder as he walked. The road from Sunspear to the Water Gardens ran beside the sea, so they had a cool fresh breeze to soothe them as they made their way across a sparse red-brown land of stone and sand and twisted stunted trees. 
¡¡¡¡Halfway there, the second Sand Snake caught them. 
¡¡¡¡She appeared suddenly upon a dune, mounted on a golden sand steed with a mane like fine white silk. Even ahorse, the Lady Nym looked graceful, dressed all in shimmering lilac robes and a great silk cape of cream and copper that lifted at every gust of wind, and made her look as if she might take flight. Nymeria Sand was five-and-twenty, and slender as a willow. Her straight black hair, worn in a long braid bound up with red-gold wire, made a widow¡¯s peak above her dark eyes, just as her father¡¯s had. With her high cheekbones, full lips, and milk-pale skin, she had all the beauty that her elder sister lacked . . . but Obara¡¯s mother had been an Oldtown whore, whilst Nym was born from the noblest blood of old Volantis. A dozen mounted spearmen tailed her, their round shields gleaming in the sun. They followed her down the dune. The prince had tied back the curtains on his litter, the better to enjoy the breeze blowing off the sea. Lady Nym fell in beside him, slowing her pretty golden mare to match the litter¡¯s pace. ¡°Well met, Uncle,¡± she sang out, as if it had been chance that brought her here. ¡°May I ride with you to Sunspear?¡± The captain was on the opposite side of the litter from Lady Nym, yet he could hear every word she said. 
¡¡¡¡¡°I would be glad of it,¡± Prince Doran replied, though he did not sound glad to the captain¡¯s ears. ¡°Gout and grief make poor companions on the road.¡± By which the captain knew him to mean that every pebble drove a spike through his swollen joints. 
¡¡¡¡¡°The gout I cannot help,¡± she said, ¡°but my father had no use for grief. Vengeance was more to his taste. Is it true that Gregor Clegane admitted slaying Elia and her children?¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°He roared out his guilt for all the court to hear,¡± the prince admitted. ¡°Lord Tywin has promised us his head.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°And a Lannister always pays his debts,¡± said Lady Nym, ¡°yet it seems to me that Lord Tywin means to pay us with our own coin. I had a bird from our sweet Ser Daemon, who swears my father tickled that monster more than once as they fought. If so, Ser Gregor is as good as dead, and no thanks to Tywin Lannister.¡± 
¡¡¡¡The prince grimaced. Whether it was from the pain of gout or his niece¡¯s words, the captain could not say. ¡°It may be so.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°May be? I say ¡¯tis.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Obara would have me go to war.¡± 
¡¡¡¡Nym laughed. ¡°Yes, she wants to set the torch to Oldtown. She hates that city as much as our little sister loves it.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°And you?¡± 
¡¡¡¡Nym glanced over a shoulder, to where her companions rode a dozen lengths behind. ¡°I was abed with the Fowler twins when the word reached me,¡± the captain heard her say. ¡°You know the Fowler words? Let Me Soar! That is all I ask of you. Let me soar, Uncle. I need no mighty host, only one sweet sister.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Obara?¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Tyene. Obara is too loud. Tyene is so sweet and gentle that no man will suspect her. Obara would make Oldtown our father¡¯s funeral pyre, but I am not so greedy. Four lives will suffice for me. Lord Tywin¡¯s golden twins, as payment for Elia¡¯s children. The old lion, for Elia herself. And last of all the little king, for my father.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°The boy has never wronged us.¡± ¡°The boy is a bastard born of treason, incest, and adultery, if Lord Stannis can be believed.¡± The playful tone had vanished from her voice, and the captain found himself watching her through narrowed eyes. Her sister Obara wore her whip upon her hip and carried a spear where any man could see it. Lady Nym was no less deadly, though she kept her knives well hidden. ¡°Only royal blood can wash out my father¡¯s murder.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Oberyn died during single combat, fighting in a matter that was none of his concern. I do not call that murder.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Call it what you will. We sent them the finest man in Dorne, and they are sending back a bag of bones.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°He went beyond anything I asked of him. ¡®Take the measure of this boy king and his council, and make note of their strengths and weaknesses,¡¯ I told him, on the terrace. We were eating oranges. ¡®Find us friends, if there are any to be found. Learn what you can of Elia¡¯s end, but see that you do not provoke Lord Tywin unduly,¡¯ those were my words to him. Oberyn laughed, and said, ¡®When have I provoked any man . . . unduly? You would do better to warn the Lannisters against provoking me.¡¯ He wanted justice for Elia, but he would not wait¡ª¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°He waited ten-and-seven years,¡± the Lady Nym broke in. ¡°Were it you they¡¯d killed, my father would have led his banners north before your corpse was cold. Were it you, the spears would be falling thick as rain upon the marches now.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°I do not doubt it.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°No more should you doubt this, my prince¡ªmy sisters and I shall not wait ten-andseven years for our vengeance.¡± She put her spurs into the mare and she was off, galloping toward Sunspear with her tail in hot pursuit. 
¡¡¡¡The prince leaned back against his pillows and closed his eyes, but Hotah knew he did not sleep. He is in pain. For a moment he considered calling Maester Caleotte up to the litter, but if Prince Doran had wanted him, he would have called himself. 
¡¡¡¡The shadows of the afternoon were long and dark and the sun was as red and swollen as the prince¡¯s joints before they glimpsed the towers of Sunspear to the east. First the slender Spear Tower, a hundred-and-a-half feet tall and crowned with a spear of gilded steel that added another thirty feet to its height; then the mighty Tower of the Sun, with its dome of gold and leaded glass; last the dun-colored Sandship, looking like some monstrous dromond that had washed ashore and turned to stone. 
¡¡¡¡Only three leagues of coast road divided Sunspear from the Water Gardens, yet they were two different worlds. There children frolicked naked in the sun, music played in tiled courtyards, and the air was sharp with the smell of lemons and blood oranges. Here the air smelled of dust, sweat, and smoke, and the nights were alive with the babble of voices. In place of the pink marble of the Water Gardens, Sunspear was built from mud and straw, and colored brown and dun. The ancient stronghold of House Martell stood at the easternmost end of a little jut of stone and sand, surrounded on three sides by the sea. To the west, in the shadows of Sunspear¡¯s massive walls, mud-brick shops and windowless hovels clung to the castle like barnacles to a galley¡¯s hull. Stables and inns and winesinks and pillow houses had grown up west of those, many enclosed by walls of their own, and yet more hovels had risen beneath those walls. And so and so and so, as the bearded priests would say. Compared to Tyrosh or Myr or Great Norvos, the shadow city was no more than a town, yet it was the nearest thing to a true city that these Dornish had. 
¡¡¡¡Lady Nym¡¯s arrival had preceded theirs by some hours, and no doubt she had warned the guards of their coming, for the Threefold Gate was open when they reached it. Only here were the gates lined up one behind the other to allow visitors to pass beneath all three of the Winding Walls directly to the Old Palace, without first making their way through miles of narrow alleys, hidden courts, and noisy bazaars. 
¡¡¡¡Prince Doran had closed the draperies of his litter as soon as the Spear Tower came in sight, yet still the smallfolk shouted out to him as the litter passed. The Sand Snakes have stirred them to a boil, the captain thought uneasily. They crossed the squalor of the outer crescent and went through the second gate. Beyond, the wind stank of tar and salt water and rotting seaweed, and the crowd grew thicker with every step. ¡°Make way for Prince Doran!¡± Areo Hotah boomed out, thumping the butt of his longaxe on the bricks. ¡°Make way for the Prince of Dorne!¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°The prince is dead!¡± a woman shrilled behind him. 
¡¡¡¡¡°To spears!¡± a man bellowed from a balcony. 
¡¡¡¡¡°Doran!¡± called some highborn voice. ¡°To the spears!¡± 
¡¡¡¡Hotah gave up looking for the speakers; the press was too thick, and a third of them were shouting. ¡°To spears! Vengeance for the Viper!¡± By the time they reached the third gate, the guards were shoving people aside to clear a path for the prince¡¯s litter, and the crowd was throwing things. One ragged boy darted past the spearmen with a half-rotten pomegranate in one hand, but when he saw Areo Hotah in his path, with longaxe at the ready, he let the fruit fall unthrown and beat a quick retreat. Others farther back let fly with lemons, limes, and oranges, crying ¡°War! War! To the spears!¡± One of the guards was hit in the eye with a lemon, and the captain himself had an orange splatter off his foot. 
¡¡¡¡No answer came from within the litter. Doran Martell stayed cloaked within his silken walls until the thicker walls of the castle swallowed all of them, and the portcullis came down behind them with a rattling crunch. The sounds of shouting dwindled away slowly. Princess Arianne was waiting in the outer ward to greet her father, with half the court about her: the old blind seneschal Ricasso, Ser Manfrey Martell the castellan, young Maester Myles with his grey robes and silky perfumed beard, twoscore of Dornish knights in flowing linen of half a hundred hues. Little Myrcella Baratheon stood with her septa and Ser Arys of the Kingsguard, sweltering in his white-enameled scales. 
¡¡¡¡Princess Arianne strode to the litter on snakeskin sandals laced up to her thighs. Her hair was a mane of jet-black ringlets that fell to the small of her back, and around her brow was a band of copper suns. She is still a little thing, the captain thought. Where the Sand Snakes were tall, Arianne took after her mother, who stood but five foot two. Yet beneath her jeweled girdle and loose layers of flowing purple silk and yellow samite she had a woman¡¯s body, lush and roundly curved. ¡°Father,¡± she announced as the curtains opened, ¡°Sunspear rejoices at your return.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Yes, I heard the joy.¡± The prince smiled wanly and cupped his daughter¡¯s cheek with a reddened, swollen hand. ¡°You look well. Captain, be so good as to help me down from here.¡± 
¡¡¡¡Hotah slid his longaxe into its sling across his back and gathered the prince into his arms, tenderly so as not to jar his swollen joints. Even so, Doran Martell bit back a gasp of pain. 
¡¡¡¡¡°I have commanded the cooks to prepare a feast for this evening,¡± Arianne said, ¡°with all your favorite dishes.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°I fear I could not do them justice.¡± The prince glanced slowly around the yard. ¡°I do not see Tyene.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°She begs a private word. I sent her to the throne room to await your coming.¡± 
¡¡¡¡The prince sighed. ¡°Very well. Captain? The sooner I am done with this, the sooner I may rest.¡± 
¡¡¡¡Hotah bore him up the long stone steps of the Tower of the Sun, to the great round chamber beneath the dome, where the last light of the afternoon was slanting down through thick windows of many-colored glass to dapple the pale marble with diamonds of half a hundred colors. There the third Sand Snake awaited them. 
¡¡¡¡She was sitting cross-legged on a pillow beneath the raised dais where the high seats stood, but she rose as they entered, dressed in a clinging gown of pale blue samite with sleeves of Myrish lace that made her look as innocent as the Maid herself. In one hand was a piece of embroidery she had been working on, in the other a pair of golden needles. Her hair was gold as well, and her eyes were deep blue pools . . . and yet somehow they reminded the captain of her father¡¯s eyes, though Oberyn¡¯s had been as black as night. All of Prince Oberyn¡¯s daughters have his viper eyes, Hotah realized suddenly. The color does not matter. 
¡¡¡¡¡°Uncle,¡± said Tyene Sand, ¡°I have been waiting for you.¡± ¡°Captain, help me to the high seat.¡± 
¡¡¡¡There were two seats on the dais, near twin to one another, save that one had the Martell spear inlaid in gold upon its back, whilst the other bore the blazing Rhoynish sun that had flown from the masts of Nymeria¡¯s ships when first they came to Dorne. The captain placed the prince beneath the spear and stepped away. 
¡¡¡¡¡°Does it hurt so much?¡± Lady Tyene¡¯s voice was gentle, and she looked as sweet as summer strawberries. Her mother had been a septa, and Tyene had an air of almost otherworldy innocence about her. ¡°Is there aught that I might do to ease your pain?¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Say what you would and let me rest. I am weary, Tyene.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°I made this for you, Uncle.¡± Tyene unfolded the piece she¡¯d been embroidering. It showed her father, Prince Oberyn, mounted on a sand steed and armored all in red, smiling. ¡°When I finish, it is yours, to help you remember him.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°I am not like to forget your father.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°That is good to know. Many have wondered.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Lord Tywin has promised us the Mountain¡¯s head.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°He is so kind . . . but a headsman¡¯s sword is no fit end for brave Ser Gregor. We have prayed so long for his death, it is only fair that he pray for it as well. I know the poison that my father used, and there is none slower or more agonizing. Soon we may hear the Mountain screaming, even here in Sunspear.¡± 
¡¡¡¡Prince Doran sighed. ¡°Obara cries to me for war. Nym will be content with murder. And you?¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°War,¡± said Tyene, ¡°though not my sister¡¯s war. Dornishmen fight best at home, so I say let us hone our spears and wait. When the Lannisters and the Tyrells come down on us, we shall bleed them in the passes and bury them beneath the blowing sands, as we have a hundred times before.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°If they should come down on us.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Oh, but they must, or see the realm riven once more, as it was before we wed the dragons. Father told me so. He said we had the Imp to thank, for sending us Princess Myrcella. She is so pretty, don¡¯t you think? I wish that I had curls like hers. She was made to be a queen, just like her mother.¡± Dimples bloomed in Tyene¡¯s cheeks. ¡°I would be honored to arrange the wedding, and to see to the making of the crowns as well. Trystane and Myrcella are so innocent, I thought perhaps white gold . . . with emeralds, to match Myrcella¡¯s eyes. Oh, diamonds and pearls would serve as well, so long as the children are wed and crowned. Then we need only hail Myrcella as the First of Her Name, Queen of the Andals, the Rhoynar, and the First Men, and lawful heir to the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros, and wait for the lions to come.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°The lawful heir?¡± The prince snorted. ¡°She is older than her brother,¡± explained Tyene, as if he were some fool. ¡°By law the Iron Throne should pass to her.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°By Dornish law.¡± ¡°When good King Daeron wed Princess Myriah and brought us into his kingdom, it was 
¡¡¡¡agreed that Dornish law would always rule in Dorne. And Myrcella is in Dorne, as it happens.¡± ¡°So she is.¡± His tone was grudging. ¡°Let me think on it.¡± Tyene grew cross. ¡°You think too much, Uncle.¡± ¡°Do I?¡± ¡°Father said so.¡± ¡°Oberyn thought too little.¡± ¡°Some men think because they are afraid to do.¡± ¡°There is a difference between fear and caution.¡± ¡°Oh, I must pray that I never see you frightened, Uncle. You might forget to breathe.¡± 
¡¡¡¡She raised a hand . . . 
¡¡¡¡The captain brought the butt of his longaxe down upon the marble with a thump. ¡°My lady, you presume. Step from the dais, if it please you.¡± ¡°I meant no harm, Captain. I love my uncle, as I know he loved my father.¡± Tyene went 
¡¡¡¡to one knee before the prince. ¡°I have said all I came to say, Uncle. Forgive me if I gave offense; my heart is broken all to pieces. Do I still have your love?¡± ¡°Always.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Give me your blessing, then, and I shall go.¡± Doran hesitated half a heartbeat before placing his hand on his niece¡¯s head. ¡°Be brave, child.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Oh, how not? I am his daughter.¡± No sooner had she taken her leave than Maester Caleotte hurried to the dais. ¡°My prince, she did not . . . here, let me see your hand.¡± He examined the palm first, then gently turned it upside down to sniff at the back of the prince¡¯s fingers. ¡°No, good. That is good. There are no scratches, so . . .¡± 
¡¡¡¡The prince withdrew his hand. ¡°Maester, could I trouble you for some milk of the poppy? A thimble cup will suffice.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°The poppy. Yes, to be sure.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Now, I think,¡± Doran Martell urged gently, and Caleotte scurried to the stairs. 
¡¡¡¡Outside the sun had set. The light within the dome was the blue of dusk, and all the diamonds on the floor were dying. The prince sat in his high seat beneath the Martell spear, his face pale with pain. After a long silence he turned to Areo Hotah. ¡°Captain,¡± he said, ¡°how loyal are my guards?¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Loyal.¡± The captain did not know what else to say. 
¡¡¡¡¡°All of them? Or some?¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°They are good men. Good Dornishmen. They will do as I command.¡± He thumped his longaxe on the floor. ¡°I will bring the head of any man who would betray you.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°I want no heads. I want obedience.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°You have it.¡± Serve. Obey. Protect. Simple vows for a simple man. ¡°How many men are needed?¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°I will leave that for you to decide. It may be that a few good men will serve us better than a score. I want this done as quickly and as quietly as possible, with no blood spilled.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Quick and quiet and bloodless, aye. What is your command?¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°You will find my brother¡¯s daughters, take them into custody, and confine them in the cells atop the Spear Tower.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°The Sand Snakes?¡± The captain¡¯s throat was dry. ¡°All . . . all eight, my prince? The little ones, also?¡± 
¡¡¡¡The prince considered. ¡°Ellaria¡¯s girls are too young to be a danger, but there are those who might seek to use them against me. It would be best to keep them safe in hand. Yes, the little ones as well . . . but first secure Tyene, Nymeria, and Obara.¡± ¡°As my prince commands.¡± His heart was troubled. My little princess will mislike this. ¡°What of Sarella? She is a woman grown, almost twenty.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Unless she returns to Dorne, there¡¯s naught I can do about Sarella save pray that she shows more sense than her sisters. Leave her to her . . . game. Gather up the others. I shall not sleep until I know that they are safe and under guard.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°It will be done.¡± The captain hesitated. ¡°When this is known in the streets, the common folk will howl.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°All Dorne will howl,¡± said Doran Martell in a tired voice. ¡°I only pray Lord Tywin hears them in King¡¯s Landing, so he might know what a loyal friend he has in Sunspear.¡± 
¡¡¡¡CERSEI 
¡¡¡¡She dreamt she sat the Iron Throne, high above them all. 
¡¡¡¡The courtiers were brightly colored mice below. Great lords and proud ladies knelt before her. Bold young knights laid their swords at her feet and pleaded for her favors, and the queen smiled down at them. Until the dwarf appeared as if from nowhere, pointing at her and howling with laughter. The lords and ladies began to chuckle too, hiding their smiles behind their hands. Only then did the queen realize she was naked. 
¡¡¡¡Horrified, she tried to cover herself with her hands. The barbs and blades of the Iron Throne bit into her flesh as she crouched to hide her shame. Blood ran red down her legs, as steel teeth gnawed at her buttocks. When she tried to stand, her foot slipped through a gap in the twisted metal. The more she struggled the more the throne engulfed her, tearing chunks of flesh from her breasts and belly, slicing at her arms and legs until they were slick and red, glistening. 
¡¡¡¡And all the while her brother capered below, laughing. 
¡¡¡¡His merriment still echoed in her ears when she felt a light touch on her shoulder, and woke suddenly. For half a heartbeat the hand seemed part of the nightmare, and Cersei cried out, but it was only Senelle. The maid¡¯s face was white and frightened. 
¡¡¡¡We are not alone, the queen realized. Shadows loomed around her bed, tall shapes with chainmail glimmering beneath their cloaks. Armed men had no business here. Where are my guards? Her bedchamber was dark, but for the lantern one of the intruders held on high. I must show no fear. Cersei pushed back sleep-tousled hair, and said, ¡°What do you want of me?¡± A man stepped into the lantern light, and she saw his cloak was white. ¡°Jaime?¡± I dreamt of one brother, but the other has come to wake me. 
¡¡¡¡¡°Your Grace.¡± The voice was not her brother¡¯s. ¡°The Lord Commander said come get you.¡± His hair curled, as Jaime¡¯s did, but her brother¡¯s hair was beaten gold, like hers, where this man¡¯s was black and oily. She stared at him, confused, as he muttered about a privy and a crossbow, and said her father¡¯s name. I am dreaming still, Cersei thought. I have not woken, nor has my nightmare ended. Tyrion will creep out from under the bed soon and begin to laugh at me. 
¡¡¡¡But that was folly. Her dwarf brother was down in the black cells, condemned to die this very day. She looked down at her hands, turning them over to make certain all her fingers were still there. When she ran a hand down her arm the skin was covered with gooseprickles, but unbroken. There were no cuts on her legs, no gashes on the soles of her feet. A dream, that¡¯s all it was, a dream. I drank too much last night, these fears are only humors born of wine. I will be the one laughing, come dusk. My children will be safe, Tommen¡¯s throne will be secure, and my twisted little valonqar will be short a head and rotting. 
¡¡¡¡Jocelyn Swyft was at her elbow, pressing a cup on her. Cersei took a sip: water, mixed with lemon squeezings, so tart she spit it out. She could hear the night wind rattling the shutters, and she saw with a strange sharp clarity. Jocelyn was trembling like a leaf, as frightened as Senelle. Ser Osmund Kettleblack loomed over her. Behind him stood Ser Boros Blount, with a lantern. At the door were Lannister guardsmen with gilded lions shining on the crests of their helmets. They looked afraid as well. Can it be? the queen wondered. Can it be true? 
¡¡¡¡She rose, and let Senelle slip a bedrobe over her shoulders to hide her nakedness. Cersei belted it herself, her fingers stiff and clumsy. ¡°My lord father keeps guards about him, night and day,¡± she said. Her tongue felt thick. She took another swallow of lemon water and sloshed it round her mouth to freshen her breath. A moth had gotten into the lantern Ser Boros was holding; she could hear it buzzing and see the shadow of its wings as it beat against the glass. 
¡¡¡¡¡°The guards were at their posts, Your Grace,¡± said Osmund Kettleblack. ¡°We found a hidden door behind the hearth. A secret passage. The Lord Commander¡¯s gone down to see where it goes.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Jaime?¡± Terror seized her, sudden as a storm. ¡°Jaime should be with the king . . .¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°The lad¡¯s not been harmed. Ser Jaime sent a dozen men to look in on him. His Grace is sleeping peaceful.¡± 
¡¡¡¡Let him have a sweeter dream than mine, and a kinder waking. ¡°Who is with the king?¡± ¡°Ser Loras has that honor, if it please you.¡± 
¡¡¡¡It did not please her. The Tyrells were only stewards that the dragon-kings had upjumped far above their station. Their vanity was exceeded only by their ambition. Ser Loras might be as pretty as a maiden¡¯s dream, but underneath his white cloak he was Tyrell to the bone. For all she knew, this night¡¯s foul fruit had been planted and nurtured in Highgarden. 
¡¡¡¡But that was a suspicion she dare not speak aloud. ¡°Allow me a moment to dress. Ser Osmund, you shall accompany me to the Tower of the Hand. Ser Boros, roust the gaolers and make certain the dwarf is still in his cell.¡± She would not say his name. He would never have found the courage to lift a hand against Father, she told herself, but she had to be certain. 
¡¡¡¡¡°As Your Grace commands.¡± Blount surrendered the lantern to Ser Osmund. Cersei was not displeased to see the back of him. Father should never have restored him to the white. The man had proved himself a craven. 
¡¡¡¡By the time they left Maegor¡¯s Holdfast, the sky had turned a deep cobalt blue, though the stars still shone. All but one, Cersei thought. The bright star of the west has fallen, and the nights will be darker now. She paused upon the drawbridge that spanned the dry moat, gazing down at the spikes below. They would not dare lie to me about such a thing. ¡°Who found him?¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°One of his guards,¡± said Ser Osmund. ¡°Lum. He felt a call of nature, and found his lordship in the privy.¡± 
¡¡¡¡No, that cannot be. That is not the way a lion dies. The queen felt strangely calm. She remembered the first time she had lost a tooth, when she was just a little girl. It hadn¡¯t hurt, but the hole in her mouth felt so odd she could not stop touching it with her tongue. 
¡¡¡¡Now there is a hole in the world where Father stood, and holes want filling. 
¡¡¡¡If Tywin Lannister was truly dead, no one was safe . . . least of all her son upon his throne. When the lion falls the lesser beasts move in: the jackals and the vultures and the feral dogs. They would try to push her aside, as they always had. She would need to move quickly, as she had when Robert died. This might be the work of Stannis Baratheon, through some catspaw. It could well be the prelude to another attack upon the city. She hoped it was. Let him come. I will smash him, just as Father did, and this time he will die. Stannis did not frighten her, no more than Mace Tyrell did. No one frightened her. She was a daughter of the Rock, a lion. There will be no more talk of forcing me to wed again. Casterly Rock was hers now, and all the power of House Lannister. No one would ever disregard her again. Even when Tommen had no further need of a regent, the Lady of Casterly Rock would remain a power in the land. 
¡¡¡¡The rising sun had painted the tower tops a vivid red, but beneath the walls the night still huddled. The outer castle was so hushed that she could have believed all its people dead. They should be. It is not fitting for Tywin Lannister to die alone. Such a man deserves a retinue to attend his needs in hell. 
¡¡¡¡Four spearmen in red cloaks and lion-crested helms were posted at the door of the Tower of the Hand. ¡°No one is to enter or leave without my permission,¡± she told them. The command came easily to her. My father had steel in his voice as well. 
¡¡¡¡Within the tower, the smoke from the torches irritated her eyes, but Cersei did not weep, no more than her father would have. I am the only true son he ever had. Her heels scraped against the stone as she climbed, and she could still hear the moth fluttering wildly inside Ser Osmund¡¯s lantern. Die, the queen thought at it, in irritation, fly into the flame and be done with it. 
¡¡¡¡Two more red-cloaked guardsmen stood atop the steps. Red Lester muttered a condolence as she passed. The queen¡¯s breath was coming fast and short, and she could feel her heart fluttering in her chest. The steps, she told herself, this cursed tower has too many steps. She had half a mind to tear it down. 
¡¡¡¡The hall was full of fools speaking in whispers, as if Lord Tywin were asleep and they were afraid to wake him. Guards and servants alike shrank back before her, mouths flapping. She saw their pink gums and waggling tongues, but their words made no more sense than the buzzing of the moth. What are they doing here? How did they know? By rights they should have called her first. She was the Queen Regent, had they forgotten that? 
¡¡¡¡Before the Hand¡¯s bedchamber stood Ser Meryn Trant in his white armor and cloak. The visor of his helm was open, and the bags beneath his eyes made him look still half-asleep. ¡°Clear these people away,¡± Cersei told him. ¡°Is my father in the privy?¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°They carried him back to his bed, m¡¯lady.¡± Ser Meryn pushed the door open for her to enter. 
¡¡¡¡Morning light slashed through the shutters to paint golden bars upon the rushes strewn across the floor of the bedchamber. Her uncle Kevan was on his knees beside the bed, trying to pray, but he could scarcely get the words out. Guardsmen clustered near the hearth. The secret door that Ser Osmund had spoken of gaped open behind the ashes, no bigger than an oven. A man would need to crawl. But Tyrion is only half a man. The thought made her angry. No, the dwarf is locked in a black cell. This could not be his work. Stannis, she told herself, Stannis was behind it. He still has adherents in the city. Him, or the Tyrells . . . 
¡¡¡¡There had always been talk of secret passages within the Red Keep. Maegor the Cruel was supposed to have killed the men who built the castle to keep the knowledge of them secret. How many other bedchambers have hidden doors? Cersei had a sudden vision of the dwarf crawling out from behind a tapestry in Tommen¡¯s bedchamber with blade in hand. Tommen is well guarded, she told herself. But Lord Tywin had been well guarded too. 
¡¡¡¡For a moment she did not recognize the dead man. He had hair like her father, yes, but this was some other man, surely, a smaller man, and much older. His bedrobe was hiked up around his chest, leaving him naked below the waist. The quarrel had taken him in his groin between his navel and his manhood, and was sunk so deep that only the fletching showed. His pubic hair was stiff with dried blood. More was congealing in his navel. 
¡¡¡¡The smell of him made her wrinkle her nose. ¡°Take the quarrel out of him,¡± she commanded. ¡°This is the King¡¯s Hand!¡± And my father. My lord father. Should I scream and tear my hair? They said Catelyn Stark had clawed her own face to bloody ribbons when the Freys slew her precious Robb. Would you like that, Father? she wanted to ask him. Or would you want me to be strong? Did you weep for your own father? Her grandfather had died when she was only a year old, but she knew the story. Lord Tytos had grown very fat, and his heart burst one day when he was climbing the steps to his mistress. Her father was off in King¡¯s Landing when it happened, serving as the Mad King¡¯s Hand. Lord Tywin was often away in King¡¯s Landing when she and Jaime were young. If he wept when they brought him word of his father¡¯s death, he did it where no one could see the tears. 
¡¡¡¡The queen could feel her nails digging into her palms. ¡°How could you leave him like this? My father was Hand to three kings, as great a man as ever strode the Seven Kingdoms. The bells must ring for him, as they rang for Robert. He must be bathed and dressed as befits his stature, in ermine and cloth-of-gold and crimson silk. Where is Pycelle? Where is Pycelle?¡± She turned to the guardsmen. ¡°Puckens, bring Grand Maester Pycelle. He must see to Lord Tywin.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°He¡¯s seen him, Your Grace,¡± said Puckens. ¡°He came and saw and went, to summon the silent sisters.¡± 
¡¡¡¡They sent for me last. The realization made her almost too angry for words. And Pycelle runs off to send a message rather than soil his soft, wrinkled hands. The man is useless. 
¡¡¡¡¡°Find Maester Ballabar,¡± she commanded. ¡°Find Maester Frenken. Any of them.¡± Puckens and Shortear ran to obey. ¡°Where is my brother?¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Down the tunnel. There¡¯s a shaft, with iron rungs set in the stone. Ser Jaime went to see how deep it goes.¡± 
¡¡¡¡He has only one hand, she wanted to shout at them. One of you should have gone. He has no business climbing ladders. The men who murdered Father might be down there, waiting for him. Her twin had always been too rash, and it would seem that even losing a hand had not taught him caution. She was about to command the guards to go down after him and bring him back when Puckens and Shortear returned with a grey-haired man between them. ¡°Your Grace,¡± said Shortear, ¡°this here claims he was a maester.¡± The man bowed low. ¡°How may I serve Your Grace?¡± 
¡¡¡¡His face was vaguely familiar, though Cersei could not place him. Old, but not so old as Pycelle. This one has some strength in him still. He was tall, though slightly stooped, with crinkles around his bold blue eyes. His throat is naked. ¡°You wear no maester¡¯s chain.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°It was taken from me. My name is Qyburn, if it please Your Grace. I treated your brother¡¯s hand.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°His stump, you mean.¡± She remembered him now. He had come with Jaime from Harrenhal. 
¡¡¡¡¡°I could not save Ser Jaime¡¯s hand, it is true. My arts saved his arm, however, mayhaps his very life. The Citadel took my chain, but they could not take my knowledge.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°You may suffice,¡± she decided. ¡°If you fail me you will lose more than a chain, I promise you. Remove the quarrel from my father¡¯s belly and make him ready for the silent sisters.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°As my queen commands.¡± Qyburn went to the bedside, paused, looked back. ¡°And how shall I deal with the girl, Your Grace?¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Girl?¡± Cersei had overlooked the second body. She strode to the bed, flung aside the heap of bloody coverlets, and there she was, naked, cold, and pink . . . save for her face, which had turned as black as Joff¡¯s had at his wedding feast. A chain of linked golden hands was half-buried in the flesh of her throat, twisted so tight that it had broken the skin. Cersei hissed like an angry cat. ¡°What is she doing here?¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°We found her there, Your Grace,¡± said Shortear. ¡°It¡¯s the Imp¡¯s whore.¡± As if that explained why she was here. 
¡¡¡¡My lord father had no use for whores, she thought. After our mother died he never touched a woman. She gave the guardsman a chilly look. ¡°This is not . . . when Lord Tywin¡¯s father died he returned to Casterly Rock to find a . . . a woman of this sort . . . bedecked in his lady mother¡¯s jewels, wearing one of her gowns. He stripped them off her, and all else as well. For a fortnight she was paraded naked through the streets of Lannisport, to confess to every man she met that she was a thief and a harlot. That was how Lord Tywin Lannister dealt with whores. He never . . . this woman was here for some other purpose, not for . . .¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Perhaps his lordship was questioning the girl about her mistress,¡± Qyburn suggested. ¡°Sansa Stark vanished the night the king was murdered, I have heard.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°That¡¯s so.¡± Cersei seized on the suggestion eagerly. ¡°He was questioning her, to be sure. There can be no doubt.¡± She could see Tyrion leering, his mouth twisted into a monkey¡¯s grin beneath the ruin of his nose. And what better way to question her than naked, with her legs well spread? the dwarf whispered. That¡¯s how I like to question her too. 
¡¡¡¡The queen turned away. I will not look at her. Suddenly it was too much even to be in the same room as the dead woman. She pushed past Qyburn, out into the hall. 
¡¡¡¡Ser Osmund had been joined by his brothers Osney and Osfryd. ¡°There is a dead woman in the Hand¡¯s bedchamber,¡± Cersei told the three Kettleblacks. ¡°No one is ever to know that she was here.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Aye, m¡¯lady.¡± Ser Osney had faint scratches on his cheek where another of Tyrion¡¯s whores had clawed him. ¡°And what shall we do with her?¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Feed her to your dogs. Keep her for a bedmate. What do I care? She was never here. I¡¯ll have the tongue of any man who dares to say she was. Do you understand me?¡± 
¡¡¡¡Osney and Osfryd exchanged a look. ¡°Aye, Your Grace.¡± 
¡¡¡¡She followed them back inside and watched as they bundled the girl up in her father¡¯s bloody blankets. Shae, her name was Shae. They had last spoken the night before the dwarf¡¯s trial by combat, after that smiling Dornish snake offered to champion him. Shae had been asking about some jewels Tyrion had given her, and certain promises Cersei might have made, a manse in the city and a knight to marry her. The queen made it plain that the whore would have nothing of her until she told them where Sansa Stark had gone. ¡°You were her maid. Do you expect me to believe that you knew nothing of her plans?¡± she had said. Shae left in tears. 
¡¡¡¡Ser Osfryd slung the bundled corpse up over his shoulder. ¡°I want that chain,¡± Cersei said. ¡°See that you do not scratch the gold.¡± Osfryd nodded and started toward the door. ¡°No, not through the yard.¡± She gestured toward the secret passage. ¡°There¡¯s a shaft down to the dungeons. That way.¡± 
¡¡¡¡As Ser Osfryd went down on one knee before the hearth, the light brightened within, and the queen heard noises. Jaime emerged bent over like an old woman, his boots kicking up puffs of soot from Lord Tywin¡¯s last fire. ¡°Get out of my way,¡± he told the Kettleblacks. 
¡¡¡¡Cersei rushed toward him. ¡°Did you find them? Did you find the killers? How many were there?¡± Surely there had been more than one. One man alone could not have killed her father. 
¡¡¡¡Her twin¡¯s face had a haggard look. ¡°The shaft goes down to a chamber where half a dozen tunnels meet. They¡¯re closed off by iron gates, chained and locked. I need to find keys.¡± He glanced around the bedchamber. ¡°Whoever did this might still be lurking in the walls. It¡¯s a maze back there, and dark.¡± She imagined Tyrion creeping between the walls like some monstrous rat. No. You are being silly. The dwarf is in his cell. ¡°Take hammers to the walls. Knock this tower down, if you must. I want them found. Whoever did this. I want them killed.¡± 
¡¡¡¡Jaime hugged her, his good hand pressing against the small of her back. He smelled of ash, but the morning sun was in his hair, giving it a golden glow. She wanted to draw his face to hers for a kiss. Later, she told herself, later he will come to me, for comfort. ¡°We are his heirs, Jaime,¡± she whispered. ¡°It will be up to us to finish his work. You must take Father¡¯s place as Hand. You see that now, surely. Tommen will need you . . .¡± 
¡¡¡¡He pushed away from her and raised his arm, forcing his stump into her face. ¡°A Hand without a hand? A bad jape, sister. Don¡¯t ask me to rule.¡± 
¡¡¡¡Their uncle heard the rebuff. Qyburn as well, and the Kettleblacks, wrestling their bundle through the ashes. Even the guardsmen heard, Puckens and Hoke the Horseleg and Shortear. It will be all over the castle by nightfall. Cersei felt the heat rising up her cheeks. ¡°Rule? I said naught of ruling. I shall rule until my son comes of age.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°I don¡¯t know who I pity more,¡± her brother said. ¡°Tommen, or the Seven Kingdoms.¡± 
¡¡¡¡She slapped him. Jaime¡¯s arm rose to catch the blow, cat-quick . . . but this cat had a cripple¡¯s stump in place of a right hand. Her fingers left red marks on his cheek. 
¡¡¡¡The sound brought their uncle to his feet. ¡°Your father lies here dead. Have the decency to take your quarrel outside.¡± 
¡¡¡¡Jaime inclined his head in apology. ¡°Forgive us, Uncle. My sister is sick with grief. She forgets herself.¡± 
¡¡¡¡She wanted to slap him again for that. I must have been mad to think he could be Hand. She would sooner abolish the office. When had a Hand ever brought her anything but grief? Jon Arryn put Robert Baratheon in her bed, and before he died he¡¯d begun sniffing about her and Jaime as well. Eddard Stark took up right where Arryn had left off; his meddling had forced her to rid herself of Robert sooner than she would have liked, before she could deal with his pestilential brothers. Tyrion sold Myrcella to the Dornishmen, made one of her sons his hostage, and murdered the other. And when Lord Tywin returned to King¡¯s Landing . . . 
¡¡¡¡The next Hand will know his place, she promised herself. It would have to be Ser Kevan. Her uncle was tireless, prudent, unfailingly obedient. She could rely on him, as her father had. The hand does not argue with the head. She had a realm to rule, but she would need new men to help her rule it. Pycelle was a doddering lickspittle, Jaime had lost his courage with his sword hand, and Mace Tyrell and his cronies Redwyne and Rowan could not be trusted. For all she knew they might have had a part in this. Lord Tyrell had to know that he would never rule the Seven Kingdoms so long as Tywin Lannister lived. I will need to move carefully with that one. The city was full of his men, and he¡¯d even managed to plant one of his sons in the Kingsguard, and meant to plant his daughter in Tommen¡¯s bed. It still made her furious to think that Father had agreed to betroth Tommen to Margaery Tyrell. The girl is twice his age and twice widowed. Mace Tyrell claimed his daughter was still virgin, but Cersei had her doubts. Joffrey had been murdered before he could bed the girl, but she had been wed to Renly first . . . A man may prefer the taste of hippocras, yet if you set a tankard of ale before him, he will quaff it quick enough. She must command Lord Varys to find out what he could. 
¡¡¡¡That stopped her where she stood. She had forgotten about Varys. He should be here. He is always here. Whenever anything of import happened in the Red Keep, the eunuch appeared as if from nowhere. Jaime is here, and Uncle Kevan, and Pycelle has come and gone, but not Varys. A cold finger touched her spine. He was part of this. He must have feared that Father meant to have his head, so he struck first. Lord Tywin had never had any love for the simpering master of whisperers. And if any man knew the Red Keep¡¯s secrets, it was surely the master of whisperers. He must have made common cause with Lord Stannis. They served together on Robert¡¯s council, after all . . . 
¡¡¡¡Cersei strode to the door of the bedchamber, to Ser Meryn Trant. ¡°Trant, bring me Lord Varys. Squealing and squirming if need be, but unharmed.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°As Your Grace commands.¡± 
¡¡¡¡But no sooner had one Kingsguard departed than another one returned. Ser Boros Blount was red-faced and puffing from his headlong rush up the steps. ¡°Gone,¡± he panted, when he saw the queen. He sank to one knee. ¡°The Imp . . . his cell¡¯s open, Your Grace . . . no sign of him anywhere . . .¡± 
¡¡¡¡The dream was true. ¡°I gave orders,¡± she said. ¡°He was to be kept under guard, night and day . . .¡± 
¡¡¡¡Blount¡¯s chest was heaving. ¡°One of the gaolers has gone missing too. Rugen, his name was. Two other men we found asleep.¡± 
¡¡¡¡It was all she could do not to scream. ¡°I hope you did not wake them, Ser Boros. Let them sleep.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Sleep?¡± He looked up, jowly and confused. ¡°Aye, Your Grace. How long shall¡ª¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Forever. See that they sleep forever, ser. I will not suffer guards to sleep on watch.¡± He is in the walls. He killed Father as he killed Mother, as he killed Joff. The dwarf would come for her as well, the queen knew, just as the old woman had promised her in the dimness of that tent. I laughed in her face, but she had powers. I saw my future in a drop of blood. My doom. Her legs were weak as water. Ser Boros tried to take her by the arm, but the queen recoiled from his touch. For all she knew he might be one of Tyrion¡¯s creatures. ¡°Get away from me,¡± she said. ¡°Get away!¡± She staggered to a settle. ¡°Your Grace?¡± said Blount. ¡°Shall I fetch a cup of water?¡± 
¡¡¡¡It is blood I need, not water. Tyrion¡¯s blood, the blood of the valonqar. The torches spun around her. Cersei closed her eyes, and saw the dwarf grinning at her. No, she thought, no, I was almost rid of you. But his fingers had closed around her neck, and she could feel them beginning to tighten. 
¡¡¡¡BRIENNE 
¡¡¡¡I am looking for a maid of three-and-ten,¡± she told the grey-haired goodwife beside the village well. ¡°A highborn maid and very beautiful, with blue eyes and auburn hair. She may have been traveling with a portly knight of forty years, or perhaps with a fool. Have you seen her?¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Not as I recall, ser,¡± the goodwife said, knuckling her forehead. ¡°But I¡¯ll keep my eye out, that I will.¡± 
¡¡¡¡The blacksmith had not seen her either, nor the septon in the village sept, the swineherd with his pigs, the girl pulling up onions from her garden, nor any of the other simple folk that the Maid of Tarth found amongst the daub-and-wattle huts of Rosby. Still, she persisted. This is the shortest road to Duskendale, Brienne told herself. If Sansa came this way, someone must have seen her. At the castle gates she posed her question to two spearmen whose badges showed three red chevronels on ermine, the arms of House Rosby. ¡°If she¡¯s on the roads these days she won¡¯t be no maid for long,¡± said the older man. The younger wanted to know if the girl had that auburn hair between her legs as well. 
¡¡¡¡I will find no help here. As Brienne mounted up again, she glimpsed a skinny boy atop a piebald horse at the far end of the village. I have not talked with that one, she thought, but he vanished behind the sept before she could seek him out. She did not trouble to chase after him. Most like he knew no more than the others had. Rosby was scarce more than a wide place in the road; Sansa would have had no reason to linger here. Returning to the road, Brienne headed north and east past apple orchards and fields of barley, and soon left the village and its castle well behind. It was at Duskendale that she would find her quarry, she told herself. If she came this way at all. 
¡¡¡¡¡°I will find the girl and keep her safe,¡± Brienne had promised Ser Jaime, back at King¡¯s Landing. ¡°For her lady mother¡¯s sake. And for yours.¡± Noble words, but words were easy. Deeds were hard. She had lingered too long and learned too little in the city. I should have set out earlier . . . but to where? Sansa Stark had vanished on the night King Joffrey died, and if anyone had seen her since, or had any inkling where she might have gone, they were not talking. Not to me, at least. 
¡¡¡¡Brienne believed the girl had left the city. If she were still in King¡¯s Landing, the gold cloaks would have turned her up. She had to have gone elsewhere . . . but elsewhere is a big place. If I were a maiden newly flowered, alone and afraid, in desperate danger, what would I do? she had asked herself. Where would I go? For her, the answer came easy. She would make her way back to Tarth, to her father. Sansa¡¯s father had been beheaded whilst she watched, however. Her lady mother was dead too, murdered at the Twins, and Winterfell, the great Stark stronghold, had been sacked and burned, its people put to the sword. She has no home to run to, no father, no mother, no brothers. She might be in the next town, or on a ship to Asshai; one seemed as likely as the other. 
¡¡¡¡Even if Sansa Stark had wanted to go home, how would she get there? The kingsroad was not safe; even a child would know that. The ironborn held Moat Cailin athwart the Neck, and at the Twins sat the Freys, who had murdered Sansa¡¯s brother and lady mother. The girl could go by sea if she had the coin, but the harbor at King¡¯s Landing was still in ruins, the river a jumble of broken quays and burned and sunken galleys. Brienne had asked along the docks, but no one could remember a ship leaving on the night King Joffrey died. A few trading ships were anchoring in the bay and off-loading by boat, one man told her, but more were continuing up the coast to Duskendale, where the port was busier than ever. 
¡¡¡¡Brienne¡¯s mare was sweet to look upon and kept a pretty pace. There were more travelers than she would have thought. Begging brothers trundled by with their bowls dangling on thongs about their necks. A young septon galloped past upon a palfrey as fine as any lord¡¯s, and later she met a band of silent sisters who shook their heads when Brienne put her question to them. A train of oxcarts lumbered south with grain and sacks of wool, and later she passed a swineherd driving pigs, and an old woman in a horse litter with an escort of mounted guards. She asked all of them if they had seen a highborn girl of three-and-ten years with blue eyes and auburn hair. None had. She asked about the road ahead as well. ¡°¡¯Twixt here and Duskendale is safe enough,¡± one man told her, ¡°but past Duskendale there¡¯s outlaws, and broken men in the woods.¡± 
¡¡¡¡Only the soldier pines and sentinels still showed green; the broadleaf trees had donned mantles of russet and gold, or else uncloaked themselves to scratch against the sky with branches brown and bare. Every gust of wind drove swirling clouds of dead leaves across the rutted road. They made a rustling sound as they scuttled past the hooves of the big bay mare that Jaime Lannister had bestowed on her. As easy to find one leaf in the wind as one girl lost in Westeros. She found herself wondering whether Jaime had given her this task as some cruel jape. Perhaps Sansa Stark was dead, beheaded for her part in King Joffrey¡¯s death, buried in some unmarked grave. How better to conceal her murder than by sending some big stupid wench from Tarth to find her? 
¡¡¡¡Jaime would not do that. He was sincere. He gave me the sword, and called it Oathkeeper. Anyway, it made no matter. She had promised Lady Catelyn that she would bring back her daughters, and no promise was as solemn as one sworn to the dead. The younger girl was long dead, Jaime claimed; the Arya the Lannisters sent north to marry Roose Bolton¡¯s bastard was a fraud. That left only Sansa. Brienne had to find her. 
¡¡¡¡Near dusk she saw a campfire burning by a brook. Two men sat beside it grilling trout, their arms and armor stacked beneath a tree. One was old and one was somewhat younger, though far from young. The younger rose to greet her. He had a big belly straining at the laces of his spotted doeskin jerkin. A shaggy untrimmed beard covered his cheeks and chin, the color of old gold. ¡°We have trout enough for three, ser,¡± he called out. 
¡¡¡¡It was not the first time Brienne had been mistaken for a man. She pulled off her greathelm, letting her hair spill free. It was yellow, the color of dirty straw, and near as brittle. Long and thin, it blew about her shoulders. ¡°I thank you, ser.¡± 
¡¡¡¡The hedge knight squinted at her so earnestly that she realized he must be nearsighted. ¡°A lady, is it? Armed and armored? Illy, gods be good, the size of her.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°I took her for a knight as well,¡± the older knight said, turning the trout. 
¡¡¡¡Had Brienne been a man, she would have been called big; for a woman, she was huge. Freakish was the word she had heard all her life. She was broad in the shoulder and broader in the hips. Her legs were long, her arms thick. Her chest was more muscle than bosom. Her hands were big, her feet enormous. And she was ugly besides, with a freckled, horsey face and teeth that seemed almost too big for her mouth. She did not need to be reminded of any of that. ¡°Sers,¡± she said, ¡°have you seen a maid of three-andten upon the road? She has blue eyes and auburn hair, and may have been in company with a portly red-faced man of forty years.¡± 
¡¡¡¡The nearsighted hedge knight scratched his head. ¡°I recall no such maid. What sort of hair is auburn?¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Browny red,¡± said the older man. ¡°No, we saw her not.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°We saw her not, m¡¯lady,¡± the younger told her. ¡°Come, dismount, the fish is almost done. Are you hungry?¡± 
¡¡¡¡She was, as it happened, but she was wary as well. Hedge knights had an unsavory reputation. ¡°A hedge knight and a robber knight are two sides of the same sword,¡± it was said. These two do not look too dangerous. ¡°Might I know your names, sers?¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°I have the honor to be Ser Creighton Longbough, of whom the singers sing,¡± said the big-bellied one. ¡°You will have heard of my deeds on the Blackwater, mayhaps. My companion is Ser Illifer the Penniless.¡± If there was a song about Creighton Longbough, it was not one Brienne had heard. Their names meant no more to her than did their arms. Ser Creighton¡¯s green shield showed only a brown chief, and a deep gouge made by some battle-axe. Ser Illifer bore gold and ermine gyronny, though everything about him suggested that painted gold and painted ermine were the only sorts he¡¯d ever known. He was sixty if he was a day, his face pinched and narrow beneath the hood of a patched roughspun mantle. Mail-clad he went, but flecks of rust spotted the iron like freckles. Brienne stood a head taller than either of them, and was better mounted and better armed in the bargain. If I fear the likes of these, I had as well swap my longsword for a pair of knitting needles. 
¡¡¡¡¡°I thank you, good sers,¡± she said. ¡°I will gladly share your trout.¡± Swinging down, Brienne unsaddled her mare and watered her before hobbling her to graze. She stacked her arms and shield and saddlebags beneath an elm. By then the trout was crisply done. Ser Creighton brought her a fish, and she sat cross-legged on the ground to eat it. 
¡¡¡¡¡°We are bound for Duskendale, m¡¯lady,¡± Longbough told her, as he pulled apart his own trout with his fingers. ¡°You would do well to ride with us. The roads are perilous.¡± 
¡¡¡¡Brienne could have told him more about the perils of the roads than he might have cared to know. ¡°I thank you, ser, but I have no need of your protection.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°I insist. A true knight must defend the gentler sex.¡± 
¡¡¡¡She touched her sword hilt. ¡°This will defend me, ser.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°A sword is only as good as the man who wields it.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°I wield it well enough.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°As you will. It would not be courteous to argue with a lady. We will see you safe to Duskendale. Three together may ride more safely than one alone.¡± 
¡¡¡¡We were three when we set out from Riverrun, yet Jaime lost his hand and Cleos Frey his life. ¡°Your mounts could not keep up with mine.¡± Ser Creighton¡¯s brown gelding was an old swaybacked creature with rheumy eyes, and Ser Illifer¡¯s horse looked weedy and half-starved. 
¡¡¡¡¡°My steed served me well enough on the Blackwater,¡± Ser Creighton insisted. ¡°Why, I did great carnage there and won a dozen ransoms. Was m¡¯lady familiar with Ser Herbert Bolling? You shall never meet him now. I slew him where he stood. When swords clash, you shall ne¡¯er find Ser Creighton Longbough to the rear.¡± 
¡¡¡¡His companion gave a dry chuckle. ¡°Creigh, leave off. The likes o¡¯ her has no need for the likes o¡¯ us.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°The likes of me?¡± Brienne was uncertain what he meant. Ser Illifer crooked a bony finger at her shield. Though its paint was cracked and peeling, the device it bore showed plain: a black bat on a field divided bendwise, silver and gold. ¡°You bear a liar¡¯s shield, to which you have no right. My grandfather¡¯s grandfather helped kill the last o¡¯ Lothston. None since has dared to show that bat, black as the deeds of them that bore it.¡± 
¡¡¡¡The shield was the one Ser Jaime had taken from the armory at Harrenhal. Brienne had found it in the stables with her mare, along with much else; saddle and bridle, chainmail hauberk and visored greathelm, purses of gold and silver and a parchment more valuable than either. ¡°I lost mine own shield,¡± she explained. 
¡¡¡¡¡°A true knight is the only shield a maiden needs,¡± declared Ser Creighton stoutly. 
¡¡¡¡Ser Illifer paid him no mind. ¡°A barefoot man looks for a boot, a chilly man a cloak. But who would cloak themselves in shame? Lord Lucas bore that bat, the Pander, and Manfryd o¡¯ the Black Hood, his son. Why wear such arms, I ask myself, unless your own sin is fouler still . . . and fresher.¡± He unsheathed his dagger, an ugly piece of cheap iron. ¡°A woman freakish big and freakish strong who hides her own true colors. Creigh, behold the Maid o¡¯ Tarth, who opened Renly¡¯s royal throat for him.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°That is a lie.¡± Renly Baratheon had been more than a king to her. She had loved him since first he came to Tarth on his leisurely lord¡¯s progress, to mark his coming of age. Her father welcomed him with a feast and commanded her to attend; elsewise she would have hidden in her room like some wounded beast. She had been no older than Sansa, more afraid of sniggers than of swords. They will know about the rose, she told Lord Selwyn, they will laugh at me. But the Evenstar would not relent. 
¡¡¡¡And Renly Baratheon had shown her every courtesy, as if she were a proper maid, and pretty. He even danced with her, and in his arms she¡¯d felt graceful, and her feet had floated across the floor. Later others begged a dance of her, because of his example. From that day forth, she wanted only to be close to Lord Renly, to serve him and protect him. But in the end she failed him. Renly died in my arms, but I did not kill him, she thought, but these hedge knights would never understand. ¡°I would have given my life for King Renly, and died happy,¡± she said. ¡°I did no harm to him. I swear it by my sword.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°A knight swears by his sword,¡± Ser Creighton said. 
¡¡¡¡¡°Swear it by the Seven,¡± urged Ser Illifer the Penniless. 
¡¡¡¡¡°By the Seven, then. I did no harm to King Renly. I swear it by the Mother. May I never know her mercy if I lie. I swear it by the Father, and ask that he might judge me justly. I swear it by the Maiden and Crone, by the Smith and the Warrior. And I swear it by the Stranger, may he take me now if I am false.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°She swears well, for a maid,¡± Ser Creighton allowed. ¡°Aye.¡± Ser Illifer the Penniless gave a shrug. ¡°Well, if she¡¯s lied, the gods will sort her out.¡± He slipped his dagger back away. ¡°The first watch is yours.¡± 
¡¡¡¡As the hedge knights slept, Brienne paced restlessly around the little camp, listening to the crackle of the fire. I should ride on whilst I can. She did not know these men, yet she could not bring herself to leave them undefended. Even in the black of night, there were riders on the road, and noises in the woods that might or might not have been owls and prowling foxes. So Brienne paced, and kept her blade loose in its scabbard. 
¡¡¡¡Her watch was easy, all in all. It was after that was hard, when Ser Illifer woke and said he would relieve her. Brienne spread a blanket on the ground, and curled up to close her eyes. I will not sleep, she told herself, bone weary though she was. She had never slept easily in the presence of men. Even in Lord Renly¡¯s camps, the risk of rape was always there. It was a lesson she had learned beneath the walls of Highgarden, and again when she and Jaime had fallen into the hands of the Brave Companions. 
¡¡¡¡The cold in the earth seeped through Brienne¡¯s blankets to soak into her bones. Before long every muscle felt clenched and cramped, from her jaw down to her toes. She wondered whether Sansa Stark was cold as well, wherever she might be. Lady Catelyn had said that Sansa was a gentle soul who loved lemon cakes, silken gowns, and songs of chivalry, yet the girl had seen her father¡¯s head lopped off and been forced to marry one of his killers afterward. If half the tales were true, the dwarf was the cruelest Lannister of all. If she did poison King Joffrey, the Imp surely forced her hand. She was alone and friendless at that court. In King¡¯s Landing, Brienne had hunted down a certain Brella, who had been one of Sansa¡¯s maids. The woman told her that there was little warmth between Sansa and the dwarf. Perhaps she had been fleeing him as well as Joffrey¡¯s murder. 
¡¡¡¡Whatever dreams Brienne dreamed were gone when dawn awoke her. Her legs were stiff as wood from the cold ground, but no one had molested her, and her goods remained untouched. The hedge knights were up and about. Ser Illifer was cutting up a squirrel for breakfast, while Ser Creighton stood facing a tree, having himself a good long piss. Hedge knights, she thought, old and vain and plump and nearsighted, yet decent men for all that. It cheered her to know that there were still decent men in the world. 
¡¡¡¡They broke their fast on roast squirrel, acorn paste, and pickles, whilst Ser Creighton regaled her with his exploits on the Blackwater, where he had slain a dozen fearsome knights that she had never heard of. ¡°Oh, it was a rare fight, m¡¯lady,¡± he said, ¡°a rare and bloody fray.¡± He allowed that Ser Illifer had fought nobly in the battle as well. Illifer himself said little. 
¡¡¡¡When time came to resume their journey, the knights fell in on either side of her, like guards protecting some great lady . . . though this lady dwarfed both of her protectors and was better armed and armored in the nonce. ¡°Did anyone pass by during your watches?¡± Brienne asked them. ¡°Such as a maid of three-and-ten, with auburn hair?¡± said Ser Illifer the Penniless. ¡°No, my lady. No one.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°I had a few,¡± Ser Creighton put in. ¡°Some farm boy on a piebald horse went by, and an hour later half a dozen men afoot with staves and scythes. They caught sight of our fire, and stopped for a long look at our horses, but I showed them a glimpse of my steel and told them to be along their way. Rough fellows, by the look o¡¯ them, and desperate too, but ne¡¯er so desperate as to trifle with Ser Creighton Longbough.¡± 
¡¡¡¡No, Brienne thought, not so desperate as that. She turned away to hide her smile. Thankfully, Ser Creighton was too intent on the tale of his epic battle with the Knight of the Red Chicken to make note of the maiden¡¯s mirth. It felt good to have companions on the road, even such companions as these two. 
¡¡¡¡It was midday when Brienne heard chanting drifting through the bare brown trees. ¡°What is that sound?¡± Ser Creighton asked. 
¡¡¡¡¡°Voices, raised in prayer.¡± Brienne knew the chant. They are beseeching the Warrior for protection, asking the Crone to light their way. 
¡¡¡¡Ser Illifer the Penniless bared his battered blade and reined in his horse to wait their coming. ¡°They are close now.¡± 
¡¡¡¡The chanting filled the woods like pious thunder. And suddenly the source of the sound appeared in the road ahead. A group of begging brothers led the way, scruffy bearded men in roughspun robes, some barefoot and some in sandals. Behind them marched threescore ragged men, women, and children, a spotted sow, and several sheep. Several of the men had axes, and more had crude wooden clubs and cudgels. In their midst there rolled a two-wheeled wayn of grey and splintered wood, piled high with skulls and broken bits of bone. When they saw the hedge knights, the begging brothers halted, and the chanting died away. ¡°Good knights,¡± one said, ¡°the Mother loves you.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°And you, brother,¡± said Ser Illifer. ¡°Who are you?¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Poor fellows,¡± said a big man with an axe. Despite the chill of the autumnal wood, he was shirtless, and on his breast was carved a seven-pointed star. Andal warriors had carved such stars in their flesh when first they crossed the narrow sea to overwhelm the kingdoms of the First Men. 
¡¡¡¡¡°We are marching to the city,¡± said a tall woman in the traces of the wayn, ¡°to bring these holy bones to Blessed Baelor, and seek succor and protection from the king.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Join us, friends,¡± urged a spare small man in a threadbare septon¡¯s robe, who wore a crystal on a thong about his neck. ¡°Westeros has need of every sword.¡± ¡°We were bound for Duskendale,¡± declared Ser Creighton, ¡°but mayhaps we could see you safely to King¡¯s Landing.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°If you have the coin to pay us for this escort,¡± added Ser Illifer, who seemed practical as well as penniless. 
¡¡¡¡¡°Sparrows need no gold,¡± the septon said. 
¡¡¡¡Ser Creighton was lost. ¡°Sparrows?¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°The sparrow is the humblest and most common of birds, as we are the humblest and most common of men.¡± The septon had a lean sharp face and a short beard, grizzled grey and brown. His thin hair was pulled back and knotted behind his head, and his feet were bare and black, gnarled and hard as tree roots. ¡°These are the bones of holy men, murdered for their faith. They served the Seven even unto death. Some starved, some were tortured. Septs have been despoiled, maidens and mothers raped by godless men and demon worshipers. Even silent sisters have been molested. Our Mother Above cries out in her anguish. It is time for all anointed knights to forsake their worldly masters and defend our Holy Faith. Come with us to the city, if you love the Seven.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°I love them well enough,¡± said Illifer, ¡°yet I must eat.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°So must all the Mother¡¯s children.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°We are bound for Duskendale,¡± Ser Illifer said flatly. 
¡¡¡¡One of the begging brothers spat, and a woman gave a moan. ¡°You are false knights,¡± said the big man with the star carved on his chest. Several others brandished their cudgels. 
¡¡¡¡The barefoot septon calmed them with a word. ¡°Judge not, for judgment is the Father¡¯s. Let them pass in peace. They are poor fellows too, lost upon the earth.¡± 
¡¡¡¡Brienne edged her mare forward. ¡°My sister is lost as well. A girl of three-and-ten with auburn hair, fair to look upon.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°All the Mother¡¯s children are fair to look upon. May the Maiden watch over this poor girl . . . and you as well, I think.¡± The septon lifted one of the traces of the wayn upon his shoulder, and began to pull. The begging brothers took up the chant once more. Brienne and the hedge knights sat upon their horses as the procession moved slowly past, following the rutted road toward Rosby. The sound of their chanting slowly dwindled away and died. 
¡¡¡¡Ser Creighton lifted one cheek off the saddle to scratch his arse. ¡°What sort of man would slay a holy septon?¡± Brienne knew what sort. Near Maidenpool, she recalled, the Brave Companions had strung a septon up by his heels from the limb of a tree and used his corpse for archery practice. She wondered if his bones were piled in that wayn with all the rest. 
¡¡¡¡¡°A man would need to be a fool to rape a silent sister,¡± Ser Creighton was saying. ¡°Even to lay hands upon one . . . it¡¯s said they are the Stranger¡¯s wives, and their female parts are cold and wet as ice.¡± He glanced at Brienne. ¡°Uh . . . beg pardon.¡± 
¡¡¡¡Brienne spurred her mare toward Duskendale. After a moment, Ser Illifer followed, and Ser Creighton came bringing up the rear. 
¡¡¡¡Three hours later they came up upon another party struggling toward Duskendale; a merchant and his serving men, accompanied by yet another hedge knight. The merchant rode a dappled grey mare, whilst his servants took turns pulling his wagon. Four labored in the traces as the other two walked beside the wheels, but when they heard the sound of horses they formed up around the wagon with quarterstaffs of ash at the ready. The merchant produced a crossbow, the knight a blade. ¡°You will forgive me if I am suspicious,¡± called the merchant, ¡°but the times are troubled, and I have only good Ser Shadrich to defend me. Who are you?¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Why,¡± Ser Creighton said, affronted, ¡°I am the famous Ser Creighton Longbough, fresh from battle on the Blackwater, and this is my companion, Ser Illifer the Penniless.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°We mean you no harm,¡± said Brienne. 
¡¡¡¡The merchant considered her doubtfully. ¡°My lady, you should be safe at home. Why do you wear such unnatural garb?¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°I am searching for my sister.¡± She dared not mention Sansa¡¯s name, with her accused of regicide. ¡°She is a highborn maid and beautiful, with blue eyes and auburn hair. Perhaps you saw her with a portly knight of forty years, or a drunken fool.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°The roads are full of drunken fools and despoiled maidens. As to portly knights, it is hard for any honest man to keep his belly round when so many lack for food . . . though your Ser Creighton has not hungered, it would seem.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°I have big bones,¡± Ser Creighton insisted. ¡°Shall we ride together for a time? I do not doubt Ser Shadrich¡¯s valor, but he seems small, and three blades are better than one.¡± 
¡¡¡¡Four blades, thought Brienne, but she held her tongue. 
¡¡¡¡The merchant looked to his escort. ¡°What say you, ser?¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Oh, these three are nought to fear.¡± Ser Shadrich was a wiry, fox-faced man with a sharp nose and a shock of orange hair, mounted on a rangy chestnut courser. Though he could not have been more than five foot two, he had a cocksure manner. ¡°The one is old, t¡¯other fat, and the big one is a woman. Let them come.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°As you say.¡± The merchant lowered his crossbow. As they resumed their journey, the hired knight dropped back and looked her up and down as if she were a side of good salt pork. ¡°You¡¯re a strapping healthy wench, I¡¯d say.¡± 
¡¡¡¡Ser Jaime¡¯s mockery had cut her deep; the little man¡¯s words hardly touched her. ¡°A giant, compared to some.¡± He laughed. ¡°I am big enough where it counts, wench.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°The merchant called you Shadrich.¡± ¡°Ser Shadrich of the Shady Glen. Some call me the Mad Mouse.¡± He turned his shield to show her his sigil, a large white mouse with fierce red eyes, on bendy brown and blue. ¡°The brown is for the lands I¡¯ve roamed, the blue for the rivers that I¡¯ve crossed. The mouse is me.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°And are you mad?¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Oh, quite. Your common mouse will run from blood and battle. The mad mouse seeks them out.¡± ¡°It would seem he seldom finds them.¡± ¡°I find enough. ¡¯Tis true, I am no tourney knight. I save my valor for the battlefield, 
¡¡¡¡woman.¡± 
¡¡¡¡Woman was marginally better than wench, she supposed. ¡°You and good Ser Creighton have much in common, then.¡± Ser Shadrich laughed. ¡°Oh, I doubt that, but it may be that you and I share a quest. A 
¡¡¡¡little lost sister, is it? With blue eyes and auburn hair?¡± He laughed again. ¡°You are not 
¡¡¡¡the only hunter in the woods. I seek for Sansa Stark as well.¡± Brienne kept her face a mask, to hide her dismay. ¡°Who is this Sansa Stark, and why do you seek her?¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°For love, why else?¡± She furrowed her brow. ¡°Love?¡± ¡°Aye, love of gold. Unlike your good Ser Creighton, I did fight upon the Blackwater, but 
¡¡¡¡on the losing side. My ransom ruined me. You know who Varys is, I trust? The eunuch has offered a plump bag of gold for this girl you¡¯ve never heard of. I am not a greedy man. If some oversized wench would help me find this naughty child, I would split the Spider¡¯s coin with her.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°I thought you were in this merchant¡¯s hire.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Only so far as Duskendale. Hibald is as niggardly as he is fearful. And he is very fearful. What say you, wench?¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°I know no Sansa Stark,¡± she insisted. ¡°I am searching for my sister, a highborn girl . . .¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°. . . with blue eyes and auburn hair, aye. Pray, who is this knight who travels with your sister? Or did you name him fool?¡± Ser Shadrich did not wait for her answer, which was good, since she had none. ¡°A certain fool vanished from King¡¯s Landing the night King Joffrey died, a stout fellow with a nose full of broken veins, one Ser Dontos the Red, formerly of Duskendale. I pray your sister and her drunken fool are not mistaken for the Stark girl and Ser Dontos. That could be most unfortunate.¡± He put his heels into his courser and trotted on ahead. 
¡¡¡¡Even Jaime Lannister had seldom made Brienne feel such a fool. You are not the only hunter in the woods. The woman Brella had told her how Joffrey had stripped Ser Dontos of his spurs, how Lady Sansa begged Joffrey for his life. He helped her flee, Brienne had decided, when she heard the tale. Find Ser Dontos, and I will find Sansa. She should have known there would be others who would see it too. Some may even be less savory than Ser Shadrich. She could only hope that Ser Dontos had hidden Sansa well. But if so, how will I ever find her? 
¡¡¡¡She hunched her shoulders down and rode on, frowning. 
¡¡¡¡Night was gathering by the time their party came upon the inn, a tall, timbered building that stood beside a river junction, astride an old stone bridge. That was the inn¡¯s name, Ser Creighton told them: the Old Stone Bridge. The innkeep was a friend of his. ¡°Not a bad cook, and the rooms have no more fleas than most,¡± he vouched. ¡°Who¡¯s for a warm bed tonight?¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Not us, unless your friend is giving them away,¡± said Ser Illifer the Penniless. ¡°We have no coin for rooms.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°I can pay for the three of us.¡± Brienne did not lack for coin; Jaime had seen to that. In her saddlebags she¡¯d found a purse fat with silver stags and copper stars, a smaller one stuffed with golden dragons, and a parchment commanding all loyal subjects of the king to assist the bearer, Brienne of House Tarth, who was about His Grace¡¯s business. It was signed in a childish hand by Tommen, the First of His Name, King of the Andals, the Rhoynar, and the First Men, and Lord of the Seven Kingdoms. Hibald was for stopping too, and bid his men to leave the wagon near the stables. Warm yellow light shone through the diamond-shaped panes of the inn¡¯s windows, and Brienne heard a stallion trumpet at the scent of her mare. She was loosening the saddle when a boy came out the stable door, and said, ¡°Let me do that, ser.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°I am no ser,¡± she told him, ¡°but you may take the horse. See that she is fed and brushed and watered.¡± 
¡¡¡¡The boy reddened. ¡°Beg pardons, m¡¯lady. I thought . . .¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°It is a common mistake.¡± Brienne gave him the reins and followed the others into the inn, with her saddlebags across a shoulder and her bedroll tucked up beneath one arm. 
¡¡¡¡Sawdust covered the plank floor of the common room, and the air smelled of hops and smoke and meat. A roast was spitting and crackling over the fire, unattended for the moment. Six locals sat about a table, talking, but they broke off when the strangers entered. Brienne could feel their eyes. Despite chainmail, cloak, and jerkin, she felt naked. When one man said, ¡°Have a look at that,¡± she knew he was not speaking of Ser Shadrich. 
¡¡¡¡The innkeep appeared, clutching three tankards in each hand and slopping ale at every step. 
¡¡¡¡¡°Do you have rooms, good man?¡± the merchant asked him. 
¡¡¡¡¡°I might,¡± the innkeep said, ¡°for them as has coin.¡± 
¡¡¡¡Ser Creighton Longbough looked offended. ¡°Naggle, is that how you would greet an old friend? ¡¯Tis me, Longbough.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°¡¯Tis you indeed. You owe me seven stags. Show me some silver and I¡¯ll show you a bed.¡± The innkeep set the tankards down one by one, slopping more ale on the table in the process. 
¡¡¡¡¡°I will pay for one room for myself, and a second for my two companions.¡± Brienne indicated Ser Creighton and Ser Illifer. 
¡¡¡¡¡°I shall take a room as well,¡± said the merchant, ¡°for myself and good Ser Shadrich. My serving men will bed down in your stables, if it please you.¡± 
¡¡¡¡The innkeep looked them over. ¡°It don¡¯t please me, but might be I¡¯ll allow it. Will you be wanting supper? That¡¯s good goat on the spit, that is.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°I shall judge its goodness for myself,¡± Hibald announced. ¡°My men will content themselves with bread and drippings.¡± And so they supped. Brienne tried the goat herself, after following the innkeep up the steps, pressing some coins into his hand, and stashing her goods in the second room he showed her. She ordered goat for Ser Creighton and Ser Illifer as well, since they had shared their trout with her. The hedge knights and the septon washed down the meat with ale, but Brienne drank a cup of goat¡¯s milk. She listened to the table talk, hoping against hope that she might hear something that would help her find Sansa. 
¡¡¡¡¡°You come from King¡¯s Landing,¡± one of the locals said to Hibald. ¡°Is it true that the Kingslayer¡¯s been crippled?¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°True enough,¡± Hibald said. ¡°He¡¯s lost his sword hand.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Aye,¡± Ser Creighton said, ¡°chewed off by a direwolf, I hear, one of them monsters come down from the north. Nought that¡¯s good ever come from the north. Even their gods are queer.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°It was not a wolf,¡± Brienne heard herself say. ¡°Ser Jaime lost his hand to a Qohorik sellsword.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°It is no easy thing to fight with your off hand,¡± observed the Mad Mouse. 
¡¡¡¡¡°Bah,¡± said Ser Creighton Longbough. ¡°As it happens, I fight as well with either hand.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Oh, I have no doubt of that.¡± Ser Shadrich lifted his tankard in salute. 
¡¡¡¡Brienne remembered her fight with Jaime Lannister in the woods. It had been all that she could do to keep his blade at bay. He was weak from his imprisonment, and chained at the wrists. No knight in the Seven Kingdoms could have stood against him at his full strength, with no chains to hamper him. Jaime had done many wicked things, but the man could fight! His maiming had been monstrously cruel. It was one thing to slay a lion, another to hack his paw off and leave him broken and bewildered. 
¡¡¡¡Suddenly the common room was too loud to endure a moment longer. She muttered her good-nights and took herself up to bed. The ceiling in her room was low; entering with a taper in her hand, Brienne had to duck or crack her head. The only furnishings were a bed wide enough to sleep six, and the stub of a tallow candle on the sill. She lit it with the taper, barred the door, and hung her sword belt from a bedpost. Her scabbard was a plain thing, wood wrapped in cracked brown leather, and her sword was plainer still. She had bought it in King¡¯s Landing, to replace the blade the Brave Companions had stolen. Renly¡¯s sword. It still hurt, knowing she had lost it. 
¡¡¡¡But she had another longsword hidden in her bedroll. She sat on the bed and took it out. Gold glimmered yellow in the candlelight and rubies smoldered red. When she slid Oathkeeper from the ornate scabbard, Brienne¡¯s breath caught in her throat. Black and red the ripples ran, deep within the steel. Valyrian steel, spell-forged. It was a sword fit for a hero. When she was small, her nurse had filled her ears with tales of valor, regaling her with the noble exploits of Ser Galladon of Morne, Florian the Fool, Prince Aemon the Dragonknight, and other champions. Each man bore a famous sword, and surely Oathkeeper belonged in their company, even if she herself did not. ¡°You¡¯ll be defending Ned Stark¡¯s daughter with Ned Stark¡¯s own steel,¡± Jaime had promised. 
¡¡¡¡Kneeling between the bed and wall, she held the blade and said a silent prayer to the Crone, whose golden lamp showed men the way through life. Lead me, she prayed, light the way before me, show me the path that leads to Sansa. She had failed Renly, had failed Lady Catelyn. She must not fail Jaime. He trusted me with his sword. He trusted me with his honor. 
¡¡¡¡Afterward she stretched out on the bed as best she could. For all its width it was not long enough, so Brienne lay across it sideways. She could hear the clatter of tankards from below, and voices drifting up the steps. The fleas that Longbough had spoken of put in their appearance. Scratching helped keep her awake. 
¡¡¡¡She heard Hibald mount the stairs, and sometime later the knights as well. ¡°. . . I never knew his name,¡± Ser Creighton was saying as he went by, ¡°but upon his shield he bore a blood-red chicken, and his blade was dripping gore . . .¡± His voice faded, and somewhere up above, a door opened and closed. 
¡¡¡¡Her candle burned out. Darkness settled over the Old Stone Bridge, and the inn grew so still that she could hear the murmur of the river. Only then did Brienne rise to gather up her things. She eased the door open, listened, made her way barefoot down the steps. Outside she donned her boots and hurried to the stables to saddle her bay mare, asking a silent pardon of Ser Creighton and Ser Illifer as she mounted. One of Hibald¡¯s serving men woke when she rode past him, but made no move to stop her. Her mare¡¯s hooves rang upon the old stone bridge. Then the trees closed in around her, black as pitch and full of ghosts and memories. I am coming for you, Lady Sansa, she thought as she rode into the darkness. Be not afraid. I shall not rest until I¡¯ve found you. 
¡¡¡¡SAMWELL 
¡¡¡¡Sam was reading about the Others when he saw the mouse. 
¡¡¡¡His eyes were red and raw. I ought not rub them so much, he always told himself as he rubbed them. The dust made them itch and water, and the dust was everywhere down here. Little puffs of it filled the air every time a page was turned, and it rose in grey clouds whenever he shifted a stack of books to see what might be hiding on the bottom. Sam did not know how long it had been since last he¡¯d slept, but scarce an inch remained of the fat tallow candle he¡¯d lit when starting on the ragged bundle of loose pages that he¡¯d found tied up in twine. He was beastly tired, but it was hard to stop. One more book, he had told himself, then I¡¯ll stop. One more folio, just one more. One more page, then I¡¯ll go up and rest and get a bite to eat. But there was always another page after that one, and another after that, and another book waiting underneath the pile. I¡¯ll just take a quick peek to see what this one is about, he¡¯d think, and before he knew he would be halfway through it. He had not eaten since that bowl of bean-and-bacon soup with Pyp and Grenn. Well, except for the bread and cheese, but that was only a nibble, he thought. That was when he took a quick glance at the empty platter, and spied the mouse feasting on the bread crumbs. 
¡¡¡¡The mouse was half as long as his pinky finger, with black eyes and soft grey fur. Sam knew he ought to kill it. Mice might prefer bread and cheese, but they ate paper too. He had found plenty of mouse droppings amongst the shelves and stacks, and some of the leather covers on the books showed signs of being gnawed. 
¡¡¡¡It is such a little thing, though. And hungry. How could he begrudge it a few crumbs? It¡¯s eating books, though . . . 
¡¡¡¡After hours in the chair Sam¡¯s back was stiff as a board, and his legs were half-asleep. He knew he was not quick enough to catch the mouse, but it might be he could squash it. By his elbow rested a massive leather-bound copy of Annals of the Black Centaur, Septon Jorquen¡¯s exhaustively detailed account of the nine years that Orbert Caswell had served as Lord Commander of the Night¡¯s Watch. There was a page for each day of his term, every one of which seemed to begin, ¡°Lord Orbert rose at dawn and moved his bowels,¡± except for the last, which said, ¡°Lord Orbert was found to have died during the night.¡± 
¡¡¡¡No mouse is a match for Septon Jorquen. Very slowly, Sam took hold of the book with his left hand. It was thick and heavy, and when he tried to lift it one-handed, it slipped from his plump fingers and thumped back down. The mouse was gone in half a heartbeat, skittery-quick. Sam was relieved. Squishing the poor little thing would have given him nightmares. ¡°You shouldn¡¯t eat the books, though,¡± he said aloud. Maybe he should bring more cheese the next time he came down here. 
¡¡¡¡He was surprised at how low the candle had burned. Had the bean-and-bacon soup been today or yesterday? Yesterday. It must have been yesterday. The realization made him yawn. Jon would be wondering what had become of him, though Maester Aemon would no doubt understand. Before he had lost his sight, the maester had loved books as much as Samwell Tarly did. He understood the way that you could sometimes fall right into them, as if each page was a hole into another world. 
¡¡¡¡Pushing himself to his feet, Sam grimaced at the pins and needles in his calves. The chair was very hard and cut into the back of his thighs when he bent over a book. I need to remember to bring a cushion. It would be even better if he could sleep down here, in the cell he¡¯d found half-hidden behind four chests full of loose pages that had gotten separated from the books they belonged to, but he did not want to leave Maester Aemon alone for so long. He had not been strong of late and required help, especially with the ravens. Aemon had Clydas, to be sure, but Sam was younger, and better with the birds. 
¡¡¡¡With a stack of books and scrolls under his left arm and the candle in his right hand, Sam made his way through the tunnels the brothers called the wormways. A pale shaft of light illuminated the steep stone steps that led up to the surface, so he knew that day had come up top. He left the candle burning in a wall niche and began the climb. By the fifth step he was puffing. At the tenth he stopped to shift the books to his right arm. 
¡¡¡¡He emerged beneath a sky the color of white lead. A snow sky, Sam thought, squinting up. The prospect made him uneasy. He remembered that night on the Fist of the First Men when the wights and the snows had come together. Don¡¯t be so craven, he thought. You have your Sworn Brothers all around you, not to mention Stannis Baratheon and all his knights. Castle Black¡¯s keeps and towers rose about him, dwarfed by the icy immensity of the Wall. A small army was crawling over the ice a quarter of the way up, where a new switchback stair was creeping upward to meet the remnants of the old one. The sounds of their saws and hammers echoed off the ice. Jon had the builders working night and day on the task. Sam had heard some of them complaining about it over supper, insisting that Lord Mormont never worked them half so hard. Without the great stair there was no way to reach the top of the Wall except by the chain winch, however. And as much as Samwell Tarly hated steps, he hated the winch cage more. He always closed his eyes when he was riding it, convinced that the chain was about to break. Every time the iron cage scraped against the ice his heart stopped beating for an instant. 
¡¡¡¡There were dragons here two hundred years ago, Sam found himself thinking, as he watched the cage making a slow descent. They would just have flown to the top of the Wall. Queen Alysanne had visited Castle Black on her dragon, and Jaehaerys, her king, had come after her on his own. Could Silverwing have left an egg behind? Or had Stannis found one egg on Dragonstone? Even if he has an egg, how can he hope to quicken it? Baelor the Blessed had prayed over his eggs, and other Targaryens had sought to hatch theirs with sorcery. All they got for it was farce and tragedy. 
¡¡¡¡¡°Samwell,¡± said a glum voice, ¡°I was coming to fetch you. I was told to bring you to the Lord Commander.¡± 
¡¡¡¡A snowflake landed on Sam¡¯s nose. ¡°Jon wants to see me?¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°As to that, I could not say,¡± said Dolorous Edd Tollett. ¡°I never wanted to see half the things I¡¯ve seen, and I¡¯ve never seen half the things I wanted to. I don¡¯t think wanting comes into it. You¡¯d best go all the same. Lord Snow wishes to speak with you as soon as he is done with Craster¡¯s wife.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Gilly.¡± ¡°That¡¯s the one. If my wet nurse had looked like her, I¡¯d still be on the teat. Mine had whiskers.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Most goats do,¡± called Pyp, as he and Grenn emerged from around the corner, with longbows in hand and quivers of arrows on their backs. ¡°Where have you been, Slayer? We missed you last night at supper. A whole roast ox went uneaten.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Don¡¯t call me Slayer.¡± Sam ignored the gibe about the ox. That was just Pyp. ¡°I was reading. There was a mouse . . .¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Don¡¯t mention mice to Grenn. He¡¯s terrified of mice.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°I am not,¡± Grenn declared with indignation. 
¡¡¡¡¡°You¡¯d be too scared to eat one.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°I¡¯d eat more mice than you would.¡± 
¡¡¡¡Dolorous Edd Tollett gave a sigh. ¡°When I was a lad, we only ate mice on special feast days. I was the youngest, so I always got the tail. There¡¯s no meat on the tail.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Where's your longbow, Sam?¡± asked Grenn. Ser Alliser used to call him Aurochs, and every day he seemed to grow into the name a little more. He had come to the Wall big but slow, thick of neck, thick of waist, red of face, and clumsy. Though his neck still reddened when Pyp twisted him around into some folly, hours of work with sword and shield had flattened his belly, hardened his arms, broadened his chest. He was strong, and shaggy as an aurochs too. ¡°Ulmer was expecting you at the butts.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Ulmer,¡± Sam said, abashed. Almost the first thing Jon Snow had done as Lord Commander was institute daily archery drill for the entire garrison, even stewards and cooks. The Watch had been placing too much emphasis on the sword and too little on the bow, he had said, a relic of the days when one brother in every ten had been a knight, instead of one in every hundred. Sam saw the sense in the decree, but he hated longbow practice almost as much as he hated climbing steps. When he wore his gloves he could never hit anything, but when he took them off he got blisters on his fingers. Those bows were dangerous. Satin had torn off half his thumbnail on a bowstring. ¡°I forgot.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°You broke the heart of the wildling princess, Slayer,¡± said Pyp. Of late, Val had taken to watching them from the window of her chamber in the King¡¯s Tower. ¡°She was looking for you.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°She was not! Don¡¯t say that!¡± Sam had only spoken to Val twice, when Maester Aemon called upon her to make sure the babes were healthy. The princess was so pretty that he oft found himself stammering and blushing in her presence. ¡°Why not?¡± asked Pyp. ¡°She wants to have your children. Maybe we should call you Sam the Seducer.¡± 
¡¡¡¡Sam reddened. King Stannis had plans for Val, he knew; she was the mortar with which he meant to seal the peace between the northmen and the free folk. ¡°I don¡¯t have time for archery today, I need to go see Jon.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Jon? Jon? Do we know anyone named Jon, Grenn?¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°He means the Lord Commander.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Ohhh. The Great Lord Snow. To be sure. Why do you want to see him? He can¡¯t even wiggle his ears.¡± Pyp wiggled his, to show he could. They were large ears, and red from cold. ¡°He¡¯s Lord Snow for true now, too bloody highborn for the likes of us.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Jon has duties,¡± Sam said in his defense. ¡°The Wall is his, and all that goes with it.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°A man has duties to his friends as well. If not for us, Janos Slynt might be our lord commander. Lord Janos would have sent Snow ranging naked on a mule. ¡®Scamper on up to Craster¡¯s Keep,¡¯ he would have said, ¡®and fetch me back the Old Bear¡¯s cloak and boots.¡¯ We saved him from that, but now he has too many duties to drink a cup of mulled wine by the fire?¡± 
¡¡¡¡Grenn agreed. ¡°His duties don¡¯t keep him from the yard. More days than not, he¡¯s out there fighting someone.¡± 
¡¡¡¡That was true, Sam had to admit. Once, when Jon came to consult with Maester Aemon, Sam had asked him why he spent so much time at swordplay. ¡°The Old Bear never trained much when he was Lord Commander,¡± he had pointed out. In answer, Jon had pressed Longclaw into Sam¡¯s hand. He let him feel the lightness, the balance, had him turn the blade so that ripples gleamed in the smoke-dark metal. ¡°Valyrian steel,¡± he said, ¡°spell-forged and razor-sharp, nigh on indestructible. A swordsman should be as good as his sword, Sam. Longclaw is Valyrian steel, but I¡¯m not. The Halfhand could have killed me as easy as you swat a bug.¡± 
¡¡¡¡Sam handed back the sword. ¡°When I try to swat a bug, it always flies away. All I do is slap my arm. It stings.¡± 
¡¡¡¡That made Jon laugh. ¡°As you will. Qhorin could have killed me as easy as you eat a bowl of porridge.¡± Sam was fond of porridge, especially when it was sweetened with honey. 
¡¡¡¡¡°I don¡¯t have time for this.¡± Sam left his friends and made his way toward the armory, clutching his books to his chest. I am the shield that guards the realms of men, he remembered. He wondered what those men would say if they realized their realms were being guarded by the likes of Grenn, Pyp, and Dolorous Edd. The Lord Commander¡¯s Tower had been gutted by fire, and Stannis Baratheon had claimed the King¡¯s Tower for his own residence, so Jon Snow had established himself in Donal Noye¡¯s modest quarters behind the armory. Gilly was leaving as Sam arrived, wrapped up in the old cloak he¡¯d given her when they were fleeing Craster¡¯s Keep. She almost rushed right past him, but Sam caught her arm, spilling two books as he did. ¡°Gilly.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Sam.¡± Her voice sounded raw. Gilly was dark-haired and slim, with the big brown eyes of a doe. She was swallowed by the folds of Sam¡¯s old cloak, her face half-hidden by its hood, but shivering all the same. Her face looked wan and frightened. 
¡¡¡¡¡°What¡¯s wrong?¡± Sam asked her. ¡°How are the babes?¡± 
¡¡¡¡Gilly pulled loose from him. ¡°They¡¯re good, Sam. Good.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Between the two of them it¡¯s a wonder you can sleep,¡± Sam said pleasantly. ¡°Which one was it that I heard crying last night? I thought he¡¯d never stop.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Dalla¡¯s boy. He cries when he wants the teat. Mine . . . mine hardly ever cries. Sometimes he gurgles, but . . .¡± Her eyes filled with tears. ¡°I have to go. It¡¯s past time that I fed them. I¡¯ll be leaking all over myself if I don¡¯t go.¡± She rushed across the yard, leaving Sam perplexed behind her. 
¡¡¡¡He had to get down on his knees to gather up the books he¡¯d dropped. I should not have brought so many, he told himself as he brushed the dirt off Colloquo Votar¡¯s Jade Compendium, a thick volume of tales and legends from the east that Maester Aemon had commanded him to find. The book appeared undamaged. Maester Thomax¡¯s Dragonkin, Being a History of House Targaryen from Exile to Apotheosis, with a Consideration of the Life and Death of Dragons had not been so fortunate. It had come open as it fell, and a few pages had gotten muddy, including one with a rather nice picture of Balerion the Black Dread done in colored inks. Sam cursed himself for a clumsy oaf as he smoothed the pages down and brushed them off. Gilly¡¯s presence always flustered him and gave rise to . . . well, risings. A Sworn Brother of the Night¡¯s Watch should not be feeling the sorts of things that Gilly made him feel, especially when she would talk about her breasts and . . . 
¡¡¡¡¡°Lord Snow is waiting.¡± Two guards in black cloaks and iron halfhelms stood by the doors of the armory, leaning on their spears. Hairy Hal was the one who¡¯d spoken. Mully helped Sam back to his feet. He blurted out thanks and hurried past them, clutching desperately at the stack of books as he made his way past the forge with its anvil and bellows. A shirt of ringmail rested on his workbench, half-completed. Ghost was stretched out beneath the anvil, gnawing on the bone of an ox to get at the marrow. The big white direwolf looked up when Sam went by, but made no sound. 
¡¡¡¡Jon¡¯s solar was back beyond the racks of spears and shields. He was reading a parchment when Sam entered. Lord Commander Mormont¡¯s raven was on his shoulder, peering down as if it were reading too, but when the bird spied Sam it spread its wings and flapped toward him crying, ¡°Corn, corn!¡± 
¡¡¡¡Shifting the books, Sam thrust his arm into the sack beside the door and came out with a handful of kernels. The raven landed on his wrist and took one from his palm, pecking so hard that Sam yelped and snatched his hand back. The raven took to the air again, and yellow and red kernels went everywhere. 
¡¡¡¡¡°Close the door, Sam.¡± Faint scars still marked Jon¡¯s cheek, where an eagle had once tried to rip his eye out. ¡°Did that wretch break the skin?¡± 
¡¡¡¡Sam eased the books down and peeled off his glove. ¡°He did.¡± He felt faint. ¡°I¡¯m bleeding.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°We all shed our blood for the Watch. Wear thicker gloves.¡± Jon shoved a chair toward him with a foot. ¡°Sit, and have a look at this.¡± He handed him the parchment. 
¡¡¡¡¡°What is it?¡± asked Sam. The raven began to hunt out corn kernels amongst the rushes. 
¡¡¡¡¡°A paper shield.¡± 
¡¡¡¡Sam sucked at the blood on his palm as he read. He knew Maester Aemon¡¯s hand on sight. His writing was small and precise, but the old man could not see where the ink had blotted, and sometimes he left unsightly smears. ¡°A letter to King Tommen?¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°At Winterfell Tommen fought my brother Bran with wooden swords. He wore so much padding he looked like a stuffed goose. Bran knocked him to the ground.¡± Jon went to the window. ¡°Yet Bran¡¯s dead, and pudgy pink-faced Tommen is sitting on the Iron Throne, with a crown nestled amongst his golden curls.¡± 
¡¡¡¡Bran¡¯s not dead, Sam wanted to say. He¡¯s gone beyond the Wall with Coldhands. The words caught in his throat. I swore I would not tell. ¡°You haven¡¯t signed the letter.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°The Old Bear begged the Iron Throne for help a hundred times. They sent him Janos Slynt. No letter will make the Lannisters love us better. Not once they hear that we¡¯ve been helping Stannis.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Only to defend the Wall, not in his rebellion.¡± Sam read the letter quickly once again. ¡°That¡¯s what it says here.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°The distinction may escape Lord Tywin.¡± Jon took the letter back. ¡°Why would he help us now? He never did before.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Well,¡± said Sam, ¡°he will not want it said that Stannis rode to the defense of the realm whilst King Tommen was playing with his toys. That would bring scorn down upon House Lannister.¡± ¡°It¡¯s death and destruction I want to bring down upon House Lannister, not scorn.¡± Jon lifted up the letter. ¡°The Night¡¯s Watch takes no part in the wars of the Seven Kingdoms,¡± he read. ¡°Our oaths are sworn to the realm, and the realm now stands in dire peril. Stannis Baratheon aids us against our foes from beyond the Wall, though we are not his men . . .¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Well,¡± said Sam, squirming, ¡°we¡¯re not. Are we?¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°I gave Stannis food, shelter, and the Nightfort, plus leave to settle some free folk in the Gift. That¡¯s all.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Lord Tywin will say it was too much.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Stannis says it¡¯s not enough. The more you give a king the more he wants. We are walking on a bridge of ice with an abyss on either side. Pleasing one king is difficult enough. Pleasing two is hardly possible.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Yes, but . . . if the Lannisters should prevail and Lord Tywin decides that we betrayed the king by aiding Stannis, it could mean the end of the Night¡¯s Watch. He has the Tyrells behind him, with all the strength of Highgarden. And he did defeat Lord Stannis on the Blackwater.¡± The sight of blood might make Sam faint, but he knew how wars were won. His own father had seen to that. 
¡¡¡¡¡°The Blackwater was one battle. Robb won all his battles and still lost his head. If Stannis can raise the north . . .¡± 
¡¡¡¡He¡¯s trying to convince himself, Sam realized, but he can¡¯t. The ravens had gone forth from Castle Black in a storm of black wings, summoning the lords of the north to declare for Stannis Baratheon and join their strength to his. Sam had sent out most of them himself. Thusfar only one bird had returned, the one they¡¯d sent to Karhold. Elsewise the silence had been thunderous. 
¡¡¡¡Even if he should somehow win the northmen to his side, Sam did not see how Stannis could hope to match the combined powers of Casterly Rock, Highgarden, and the Twins. Yet without the north, his cause was surely doomed. As doomed as the Night¡¯s Watch, if Lord Tywin marks us down as traitors. ¡°The Lannisters have northmen of their own. Lord Bolton and his bastard.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Stannis has the Karstarks. If he can win White Harbor . . .¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°If,¡± Sam stressed. ¡°If not . . . my lord, even a paper shield is better than none.¡± 
¡¡¡¡Jon rattled the letter. ¡°I suppose so.¡± He sighed, then took up a quill and scrawled a signature across the bottom of the letter. ¡°Get the sealing wax.¡± Sam heated a stick of black wax over a candle and dribbled some onto the parchment, then watched as Jon pressed the Lord Commander¡¯s seal down firmly on the puddle. ¡°Take this to Maester Aemon when you leave,¡± he commanded, ¡°and tell him to dispatch a bird to King¡¯s Landing.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°I will.¡± Sam hesitated. ¡°My lord, if I might ask . . . I saw Gilly leaving. She was almost crying.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Val sent her to plead for Mance again.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Oh.¡± Val was the sister of the woman the King-beyond-the-Wall had taken for his queen. The wildling princess was what Stannis and his men were calling her. Her sister Dalla had died during the battle, though no blade had ever touched her; she had perished giving birth to Mance Rayder¡¯s son. Rayder himself would soon follow her to the grave, if the whispers Sam had heard had any truth to them. ¡°What did you tell her?¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°That I would speak to Stannis, though I doubt my words will sway him. A king¡¯s first duty is to defend the realm, and Mance attacked it. His Grace is not like to forget that. My father used to say that Stannis Baratheon was a just man. No one has ever said he was forgiving.¡± Jon paused, frowning. ¡°I would sooner take off Mance¡¯s head myself. He was a man of the Night¡¯s Watch, once. By rights, his life belongs to us.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Pyp says that Lady Melisandre means to give him to the flames, to work some sorcery.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Pyp should learn to hold his tongue. I have heard the same from others. King¡¯s blood, to wake a dragon. Where Melisandre thinks to find a sleeping dragon, no one is quite sure. It¡¯s nonsense. Mance¡¯s blood is no more royal than mine own. He has never worn a crown nor sat a throne. He¡¯s a brigand, nothing more. There¡¯s no power in brigand¡¯s blood.¡± 
¡¡¡¡The raven looked up from the floor. ¡°Blood,¡± it screamed. 
¡¡¡¡Jon paid no mind. ¡°I am sending Gilly away.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Oh.¡± Sam bobbed his head. ¡°Well, that¡¯s . . . that¡¯s good, my lord.¡± It would be the best thing for her, to go somewhere warm and safe, well away from the Wall and the fighting. 
¡¡¡¡¡°Her and the boy. We will need to find another wet nurse for his milk brother.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Goat¡¯s milk might serve, until you do. It¡¯s better for a babe than cow¡¯s milk.¡± Sam had read that somewhere. He shifted in his seat. ¡°My lord, when I was looking through the annals I came on another boy commander. Four hundred years before the Conquest. Osric Stark was ten when he was chosen, but he served for sixty years. That¡¯s four, my lord. You¡¯re not even close to being the youngest ever chosen. You¡¯re fifth youngest, so far.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°The younger four all being sons, brothers, or bastards of the King in the North. Tell me something useful. Tell me of our enemy.¡± ¡°The Others.¡± Sam licked his lips. ¡°They are mentioned in the annals, though not as often as I would have thought. The annals I¡¯ve found and looked at, that is. There¡¯s more I haven¡¯t found, I know. Some of the older books are falling to pieces. The pages crumble when I try and turn them. And the really old books . . . either they have crumbled all away or they are buried somewhere that I haven¡¯t looked yet or . . . well, it could be that there are no such books, and never were. The oldest histories we have were written after the Andals came to Westeros. The First Men only left us runes on rocks, so everything we think we know about the Age of Heroes and the Dawn Age and the Long Night comes from accounts set down by septons thousands of years later. There are archmaesters at the Citadel who question all of it. Those old histories are full of kings who reigned for hundreds of years, and knights riding around a thousand years before there were knights. You know the tales, Brandon the Builder, Symeon Star-Eyes, Night¡¯s King . . . we say that you¡¯re the nine hundred and ninety-eighth Lord Commander of the Night¡¯s Watch, but the oldest list I¡¯ve found shows six hundred seventy-four commanders, which suggests that it was written during . . .¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Long ago,¡± Jon broke in. ¡°What about the Others?¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°I found mention of dragonglass. The children of the forest used to give the Night¡¯s Watch a hundred obsidian daggers every year, during the Age of Heroes. The Others come when it is cold, most of the tales agree. Or else it gets cold when they come. Sometimes they appear during snowstorms and melt away when the skies clear. They hide from the light of the sun and emerge by night . . . or else night falls when they emerge. Some stories speak of them riding the corpses of dead animals. Bears, direwolves, mammoths, horses, it makes no matter, so long as the beast is dead. The one that killed Small Paul was riding a dead horse, so that part¡¯s plainly true. Some accounts speak of giant ice spiders too. I don¡¯t know what those are. Men who fall in battle against the Others must be burned, or else the dead will rise again as their thralls.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°We knew all this. The question is, how do we fight them?¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°The armor of the Others is proof against most ordinary blades, if the tales can be believed,¡± said Sam, ¡°and their own swords are so cold they shatter steel. Fire will dismay them, though, and they are vulnerable to obsidian.¡± He remembered the one he had faced in the haunted forest, and how it had seemed to melt away when he stabbed it with the dragonglass dagger Jon had made for him. ¡°I found one account of the Long Night that spoke of the last hero slaying Others with a blade of dragonsteel. Supposedly they could not stand against it.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Dragonsteel?¡± Jon frowned. ¡°Valyrian steel?¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°That was my first thought as well.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°So if I can just convince the lords of the Seven Kingdoms to give us their Valyrian blades, all is saved? That won¡¯t be hard.¡± His laugh had no mirth in it. ¡°Did you find who the Others are, where they come from, what they want?¡± ¡°Not yet, my lord, but it may be that I¡¯ve just been reading the wrong books. There are hundreds I have not looked at yet. Give me more time and I will find whatever there is to be found.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°There is no more time.¡± Jon sounded sad. ¡°You need to get your things together, Sam. You¡¯re going with Gilly.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Going?¡± For a moment Sam did not understand. ¡°I¡¯m going? To Eastwatch, my lord? Or . . . where am I . . .¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Oldtown.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Oldtown?¡± It came out in a squeak. Horn Hill was close to Oldtown. Home. The notion made him light-headed. My father. 
¡¡¡¡¡°Aemon as well.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Aemon? Maester Aemon? But . . . he¡¯s one hundred and two years old, my lord, he can¡¯t . . . you¡¯re sending him and me? Who will tend the ravens? If they¡¯re sick or wounded, who . . .¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Clydas. He¡¯s been with Aemon for years.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Clydas is only a steward, and his eyes are going bad. You need a maester. Maester Aemon is so frail, a sea voyage . . .¡± He thought of the Arbor and the Arbor Queen, and almost choked on his tongue. ¡°It might . . . he¡¯s old, and . . .¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°His life will be at risk. I am aware of that, Sam, but the risk is greater here. Stannis knows who Aemon is. If the red woman requires king¡¯s blood for her spells . . .¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Oh.¡± Sam paled. 
¡¡¡¡¡°Dareon will join you at Eastwatch. My hope is that his songs will win some men for us in the south. The Blackbird will deliver you to Braavos. From there you¡¯ll arrange your own passage to Oldtown. If you still mean to claim Gilly¡¯s babe as your bastard, send her and the child on to Horn Hill. Elsewise, Aemon will find a servant¡¯s place for her at the Citadel.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°My b-b-bastard.¡± He had said that, yes, but . . . All that water. I could drown. Ships sink all the time, and autumn is a stormy season. Gilly would be with him, though, and the babe would grow up safe. ¡°Yes, I . . . my mother and my sisters will help Gilly with the child.¡± I can send a letter, I won¡¯t need to go to Horn Hill myself. ¡°Dareon could see her to Oldtown just as well as me. I¡¯m . . . I¡¯ve been working at my archery every afternoon with Ulmer, as you commanded . . . well, except when I¡¯m in the vaults, but you told me to find out about the Others. The longbow makes my shoulders ache and raises blisters on my fingers.¡± He showed Jon where one had burst. ¡°I still do it, though. I can hit the target more often than not now, but I¡¯m still the worst archer who ever bent a bow. I like Ulmer¡¯s stories, though. Someone needs to write them down and put them in a book.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°You do it. They have parchment and ink at the Citadel, as well as longbows. I will expect you to continue with your practice. Sam, the Night¡¯s Watch has hundreds of men who can loose an arrow, but only a handful who can read or write. I need you to become my new maester.¡± 
¡¡¡¡The word made him flinch. No, Father, please, I won¡¯t speak of it again, I swear it by the Seven. Let me out, please let me out. ¡°My lord, I . . . my work is here, the books . . .¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°. . . will be here when you return to us.¡± 
¡¡¡¡Sam put a hand to his throat. He could almost feel the chain there, choking him. ¡°My lord, the Citadel . . . they make you cut up corpses there.¡± They make you wear a chain about your neck. If it is chains you want, come with me. For three days and three nights Sam had sobbed himself to sleep, manacled hand and foot to a wall. The chain around his throat was so tight it broke the skin, and whenever he rolled the wrong way in his sleep it would cut off his breath. ¡°I cannot wear a chain.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°You can. You will. Maester Aemon is old and blind. His strength is leaving him. Who will take his place when he dies? Maester Mullin at the Shadow Tower is more fighter than scholar, and Maester Harmune of Eastwatch is drunk more than he¡¯s sober.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°If you ask the Citadel for more maesters . . .¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°I mean to. We¡¯ll have need of every one. Aemon Targaryen is not so easily replaced, however.¡± Jon seemed puzzled. ¡°I was certain this would please you. There are so many books at the Citadel that no man can hope to read them all. You would do well there, Sam. I know you would.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°No. I could read the books, but . . . a m-maester must be a healer and b-b-blood makes me faint.¡± He held out a shaky hand for Jon to see. ¡°I¡¯m Sam the Scared, not Sam the Slayer.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Scared? Of what? The chidings of old men? Sam, you saw the wights come swarming up the Fist, a tide of living dead men with black hands and bright blue eyes. You slew an Other.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°It was the d-d-d-dragonglass, not me.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Be quiet. You lied and schemed and plotted to make me Lord Commander. You will obey me. You¡¯ll go to the Citadel and forge a chain, and if you have to cut up corpses, so be it. At least in Oldtown the corpses won¡¯t object.¡± He doesn¡¯t understand. ¡°My lord,¡± Sam said, ¡°my f-f-f-father, Lord Randyll, he, he, he, he, he . . . the life of a maester is a life of servitude.¡± He was babbling, he knew. ¡°No son of House Tarly will ever wear a chain. The men of Horn Hill do not bow and scrape to petty lords.¡± If it is chains you want, come with me. ¡°Jon, I cannot disobey my father.¡± 
¡¡¡¡Jon, he¡¯d said, but Jon was gone. It was Lord Snow who faced him now, grey eyes as hard as ice. ¡°You have no father,¡± said Lord Snow. ¡°Only brothers. Only us. Your life belongs to the Night¡¯s Watch, so go and stuff your smallclothes into a sack, along with anything else you care to take to Oldtown. You leave an hour before sunrise. And here¡¯s another order. From this day forth, you will not call yourself a craven. You¡¯ve faced more things this past year than most men face in a lifetime. You can face the Citadel, but you¡¯ll face it as a Sworn Brother of the Night¡¯s Watch. I can¡¯t command you to be brave, but I can command you to hide your fears. You said the words, Sam. Remember?¡± 
¡¡¡¡I am the sword in the darkness. But he was wretched with a sword, and the darkness scared him. ¡°I . . . I¡¯ll try.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°You won¡¯t try. You will obey.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Obey.¡± Mormont¡¯s raven flapped its great black wings. 
¡¡¡¡¡°As my lord commands. Does . . . does Maester Aemon know?¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°It was as much his idea as mine.¡± Jon opened the door for him. ¡°No farewells. The fewer folk who know of this, the better. An hour before first light, by the lichyard.¡± 
¡¡¡¡Sam did not recall leaving the armory. The next thing he knew he was stumbling through mud and patches of old snow, toward Maester Aemon¡¯s chambers. I could hide, he told himself. I could hide in the vaults amongst the books. I could live down there with the mouse and sneak up at night to steal food. Crazed thoughts, he knew, as futile as they were desperate. The vaults were the first place they would look for him. The last place they would look for him was beyond the Wall, but that was even madder. The wildlings would catch me and kill me slowly. They might burn me alive, the way the red woman means to burn Mance Rayder. 
¡¡¡¡When he found Maester Aemon in the rookery, he gave him Jon¡¯s letter and blurted out his fears in a great green gush of words. ¡°He does not understand.¡± Sam felt as if he might throw up. ¡°If I don a chain, my lord f-f-f-father . . . he, he, he . . .¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°My own father raised the same objections when I chose a life of service,¡± the old man said. ¡°It was his father who sent me to the Citadel. King Daeron had sired four sons, and three had sons of their own. Too many dragons are as dangerous as too few, I heard His Grace tell my lord father, the day they sent me off.¡± Aemon raised a spotted hand to the chain of many metals that dangled loose about his thin neck. ¡°The chain is heavy, Sam, but my grandsire had the right of it. So does your Lord Snow.¡± ¡°Snow,¡± a raven muttered. ¡°Snow,¡± another echoed. All of them picked it up then. ¡°Snow, snow, snow, snow, snow.¡± Sam had taught them that word. There was no help here, he saw. Maester Aemon was as trapped as he was. He will die at sea, he thought, despairing. He is too old to survive such a voyage. Gilly¡¯s little son may die as well, he¡¯s not as large and strong as Dalla¡¯s boy. Does Jon mean to kill us all? 
¡¡¡¡The next morning, Sam found himself saddling the mare he¡¯d ridden from Horn Hill and leading her toward the lichyard beside the eastern road. Her saddlebags bulged with cheese and sausages and hard-cooked eggs, and half a salted ham that Three-Finger Hobb had given him on his name day. ¡°You¡¯re a man who appreciates cooking, Slayer,¡± the cook had said. ¡°We need more o¡¯ your sort.¡± The ham would help, no doubt. Eastwatch was a long cold ride away, and there were no towns nor inns in the shadow of the Wall. 
¡¡¡¡The hour before dawn was dark and still. Castle Black seemed strangely hushed. At the lichyard, a pair of two-wheeled wayns awaited him, along with Black Jack Bulwer and a dozen seasoned rangers, tough as the garrons they rode. Kedge Whiteye cursed loudly when his one good eye spied Sam. ¡°Don¡¯t mind him, Slayer,¡± said Black Jack. ¡°He lost a wager, said we¡¯d need to drag you out squealing from beneath some bed.¡± 
¡¡¡¡Maester Aemon was too frail to ride a horse, so a wayn had been made ready for him, its bed heaped high with furs, and a leather awning fastened overhead to keep off the rain and snow. Gilly and her child would ride with him. The second wayn would carry their clothing and possessions, along with a chest of rare old books that Aemon thought the Citadel might lack. Sam had spent half the night searching for them, though he¡¯d found only one in four. And a good thing, or we¡¯d need another wayn. 
¡¡¡¡When the maester appeared, he was bundled up in a bearskin three times his size. As Clydas led him toward the wayn, a gust of wind came up, and the old man staggered. Sam hurried to his side and put an arm about him. Another gust like that could blow him over the Wall. ¡°Keep hold of my arm, maester. It¡¯s not far.¡± 
¡¡¡¡The blind man nodded as the wind pushed back their hoods. ¡°It is always warm in Oldtown. There is an inn on an island in the Honeywine where I used to go when I was a young novice. It will be pleasant to sit there once again, sipping cider.¡± 
¡¡¡¡By the time they got the maester into the wayn, Gilly had appeared, the child bundled in her arms. Beneath her hood her eyes were red from crying. Jon turned up at the same time, with Dolorous Edd. ¡°Lord Snow,¡± Maester Aemon called, ¡°I left a book for you in my chambers. The Jade Compendium. It was written by the Volantene adventurer Colloquo Votar, who traveled to the east and visited all the lands of the Jade Sea. There is a passage you may find of interest. I¡¯ve told Clydas to mark it for you.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°I¡¯ll be sure to read it,¡± Jon Snow replied. A line of pale snot ran from Maester Aemon¡¯s nose. He wiped it away with the back of his glove. ¡°Knowledge is a weapon, Jon. Arm yourself well before you ride forth to battle.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°I will.¡± A light snow had begun to fall, the big soft flakes drifting down lazily from the sky. Jon turned to Black Jack Bulwer. ¡°Make as good a time as you can, but take no foolish risks. You have an old man and a suckling babe with you. See that you keep them warm and well fed.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°You do the same, m¡¯lord,¡± said Gilly. ¡°You do the same for t¡¯other. Find another wet nurse, like you said. You promised me you would. The boy . . . Dalla¡¯s boy . . . the little prince, I mean . . . you find him some good woman, so he grows up big and strong.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°You have my word,¡± Jon Snow said solemnly. 
¡¡¡¡¡°Don¡¯t you name him. Don¡¯t you do that till he¡¯s past two years. It¡¯s ill luck to name them when they¡¯re still on the breast. You crows may not know that, but it¡¯s true.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°As you command, my lady.¡± 
¡¡¡¡A spasm of anger flashed across Gilly¡¯s face. ¡°Don¡¯t you call me that. I¡¯m a mother, not a lady. I¡¯m Craster¡¯s wife and Craster¡¯s daughter, and a mother.¡± 
¡¡¡¡Dolorous Edd took the babe as Gilly climbed into the wayn and covered her legs with some musty pelts. By then the eastern sky was more grey than black. Left Hand Lew was anxious to be off. Edd handed the infant up and Gilly put him to her breast. This may be the last I ever see of Castle Black, thought Sam as he hoisted himself atop his mare. As much as he had once hated Castle Black, it was tearing him apart to leave it. 
¡¡¡¡¡°Let¡¯s do this,¡± Bulwer commanded. A whip snapped, and the wayns began to rumble slowly down the rutted road as the snow came down around them. Sam lingered beside Clydas and Dolorous Edd and Jon Snow. ¡°Well,¡± he said, ¡°farewell.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°And to you, Sam,¡± said Dolorous Edd. ¡°Your boat¡¯s not like to sink, I don¡¯t think. Boats only sink when I¡¯m aboard.¡± 
¡¡¡¡Jon was watching the wayns. ¡°The first time I saw Gilly,¡± he said, ¡°she was pressed back against the wall of Craster¡¯s Keep, this skinny dark-haired girl with her big belly, cringing away from Ghost. He had gotten in among her rabbits, and I think she was frightened that he would tear her open and devour the babe . . . but it was not the wolf she should have been afraid of, was it?¡± 
¡¡¡¡No, Sam thought. Craster was the danger, her own father. 
¡¡¡¡¡°She has more courage than she knows.¡± ¡°So do you, Sam. Have a swift, safe voyage, and take care of her and Aemon and the child.¡± Jon smiled a strange, sad smile. ¡°And pull your hood up. The snowflakes are melting in your hair.¡± 
¡¡¡¡ARYA 
¡¡¡¡Faint and far away the light burned, low on the horizon, shining through the sea mists. 
¡¡¡¡¡°It looks like a star,¡± said Arya. 
¡¡¡¡¡°The star of home,¡± said Denyo. 
¡¡¡¡His father was shouting orders. Sailors scrambled up and down the three tall masts and moved along the rigging, reefing the heavy purple sails. Below, oarsmen heaved and strained over two great banks of oars. The decks tilted, creaking, as the galleas Titan¡¯s Daughter heeled to starboard and began to come about. 
¡¡¡¡The star of home. Arya stood at the prow, one hand resting on the gilded figurehead, a maiden with a bowl of fruit. For half a heartbeat she let herself pretend that it was her home ahead. 
¡¡¡¡But that was stupid. Her home was gone, her parents dead, and all her brothers slain but Jon Snow on the Wall. That was where she had wanted to go. She told the captain as much, but even the iron coin did not sway him. Arya never seemed to find the places she set out to reach. Yoren had sworn to deliver her to Winterfell, only she had ended up in Harrenhal and Yoren in his grave. When she escaped Harrenhal for Riverrun, Lem and Anguy and Tom o¡¯ Sevens took her captive and dragged her to the hollow hill instead. Then the Hound had stolen her and dragged her to the Twins. Arya had left him dying by the river and gone ahead to Saltpans, hoping to take passage for Eastwatch-by-the-Sea, only . . . 
¡¡¡¡Braavos might not be so bad. Syrio was from Braavos, and Jaqen might be there as well. 
¡¡¡¡It was Jaqen who had given her the iron coin. He hadn¡¯t truly been her friend, the way that Syrio had, but what good had friends ever done her? I don¡¯t need any friends, so long as I have Needle. She brushed the ball of her thumb across the sword¡¯s smooth pommel, wishing, wishing . . . 
¡¡¡¡If truth be told, Arya did not know what to wish for, any more than she knew what awaited her beneath that distant light. The captain had given her passage but he had no time to speak with her. Some of the crew shunned her, but others gave her gifts¡ªa silver fork, fingerless gloves, a floppy woolen hat patched with leather. One man showed her how to tie sailor¡¯s knots. Another poured her thimble cups of fire wine. The friendly ones would tap their chests, repeating their names over and over until Arya said them back, though none ever thought to ask her name. They called her Salty, since she¡¯d come aboard at Saltpans, near the mouth of the Trident. It was as good a name as any, she supposed. 
¡¡¡¡The last of the night¡¯s stars had vanished . . . all but the pair dead ahead. ¡°It¡¯s two stars now.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Two eyes,¡± said Denyo. ¡°The Titan sees us.¡± 
¡¡¡¡The Titan of Braavos. Old Nan had told them stories of the Titan back in Winterfell. He was a giant as tall as a mountain, and whenever Braavos stood in danger he would wake with fire in his eyes, his rocky limbs grinding and groaning as he waded out into the sea to smash the enemies. ¡°The Braavosi feed him on the juicy pink flesh of little highborn girls,¡± Nan would end, and Sansa would give a stupid squeak. But Maester Luwin said the Titan was only a statue, and Old Nan¡¯s stories were only stories. 
¡¡¡¡Winterfell is burned and fallen, Arya reminded herself. Old Nan and Maester Luwin were both dead, most like, and Sansa too. It did no good to think of them. All men must die. That was what the words meant, the words that Jaqen H¡¯ghar had taught her when he gave her the worn iron coin. She had learned more Braavosi words since they left Saltpans, the words for please and thank you and sea and star and fire wine, but she came to them knowing that all men must die. Most of the Daughter¡¯s crew had a smattering of the Common Tongue from nights ashore in Oldtown and King¡¯s Landing and Maidenpool, though only the captain and his sons spoke it well enough to talk to her. Denyo was the youngest of those sons, a plump, cheerful boy of twelve who kept his father¡¯s cabin and helped his eldest brother do his sums. 
¡¡¡¡¡°I hope your Titan isn¡¯t hungry,¡± Arya told him. 
¡¡¡¡¡°Hungry?¡± Denyo said, confused. 
¡¡¡¡¡°It takes no matter.¡± Even if the Titan did eat juicy pink girl flesh, Arya would not fear him. She was a scrawny thing, no proper meal for a giant, and almost eleven, practically a woman grown. And Salty isn¡¯t highborn, either. ¡°Is the Titan the god of Braavos?¡± she asked. ¡°Or do you have the Seven?¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°All gods are honored in Braavos.¡± The captain¡¯s son loved to talk about his city almost as much as he loved to talk about his father¡¯s ship. ¡°Your Seven have a sept here, the Sept-Beyond-the-Sea, but only Westerosi sailors worship there.¡± 
¡¡¡¡They are not my Seven. They were my mother¡¯s gods, and they let the Freys murder her at the Twins. She wondered whether she would find a godswood in Braavos, with a weirwood at its heart. Denyo might know, but she could not ask him. Salty was from Saltpans, and what would a girl from Saltpans know about the old gods of the north? The old gods are dead, she told herself, with Mother and Father and Robb and Bran and Rickon, all dead. A long time ago, she remembered her father saying that when the cold winds blow the lone wolf dies and the pack survives. He had it all backwards. Arya, the lone wolf, still lived, but the wolves of the pack had been taken and slain and skinned. 
¡¡¡¡¡°The Moonsingers led us to this place of refuge, where the dragons of Valyria could not find us,¡± Denyo said. ¡°Theirs is the greatest temple. We esteem the Father of Waters as well, but his house is built anew whenever he takes his bride. The rest of the gods dwell together on an isle in the center of the city. That is where you will find the . . . the Many-Faced God.¡± 
¡¡¡¡The Titan¡¯s eyes seemed brighter now, and farther apart. Arya did not know any Many-Faced God, but if he answered prayers, he might be the god she sought. Ser Gregor, she thought, Dunsen, Raff the Sweetling, Ser Ilyn, Ser Meryn, Queen Cersei. Only six now. Joffrey was dead, the Hound had slain Polliver, and she¡¯d stabbed the Tickler herself, and that stupid squire with the pimple. I wouldn¡¯t have killed him if he hadn¡¯t grabbed me. The Hound had been dying when she left him on the banks of the Trident, burning up with fever from his wound. I should have given him the gift of mercy and put a knife into his heart. 
¡¡¡¡¡°Salty, look!¡± Denyo took her by the arm and turned her. ¡°Can you see? There.¡± He pointed. 
¡¡¡¡The mists gave way before them, ragged grey curtains parted by their prow. The Titan¡¯s Daughter cleaved through the grey-green waters on billowing purple wings. Arya could hear the cries of seabirds overhead. There, where Denyo pointed, a line of stony ridges rose sudden from the sea, their steep slopes covered with soldier pines and black spruce. But dead ahead the sea had broken through, and there above the open water the Titan towered, with his eyes blazing and his long green hair blowing in the wind. 
¡¡¡¡His legs bestrode the gap, one foot planted on each mountain, his shoulders looming tall above the jagged crests. His legs were carved of solid stone, the same black granite as the sea monts on which he stood, though around his hips he wore an armored skirt of greenish bronze. His breastplate was bronze as well, and his head in his crested halfhelm. His blowing hair was made of hempen ropes dyed green, and huge fires burned in the caves that were his eyes. One hand rested atop the ridge to his left, bronze fingers coiled about a knob of stone; the other thrust up into the air, clasping the hilt of a broken sword. 
¡¡¡¡He is only a little bigger than King Baelor¡¯s statue in King¡¯s Landing, she told herself when they were still well off to sea. As the galleas drove closer to where the breakers smashed against the ridgeline, however, the Titan grew larger still. She could hear Denyo¡¯s father bellowing commands in his deep voice, and up in the rigging men were bringing in the sails. We are going to row beneath the Titan¡¯s legs. Arya could see the arrow slits in the great bronze breastplate, and stains and speckles on the Titan¡¯s arms and shoulders where the seabirds nested. Her neck craned upward. Baelor the Blessed would not reach his knee. He could step right over the walls of Winterfell. 
¡¡¡¡Then the Titan gave a mighty roar. 
¡¡¡¡The sound was as huge as he was, a terrible groaning and grinding, so loud it drowned out even the captain¡¯s voice and the crash of the waves against those pine-clad ridges. A thousand seabirds took to the air at once, and Arya flinched until she saw that Denyo was laughing. ¡°He warns the Arsenal of our coming, that is all,¡± he shouted. ¡°You must not be afraid.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°I never was,¡± Arya shouted back. ¡°It was loud, is all.¡± 
¡¡¡¡Wind and wave had the Titan¡¯s Daughter hard in hand now, driving her swiftly toward the channel. Her double bank of oars stroked smoothly, lashing the sea to white foam as the Titan¡¯s shadow fell upon them. For a moment it seemed as though they must surely smash up against the stones beneath his legs. Huddled by Denyo at the prow, Arya could taste salt where the spray had touched her face. She had to look straight up to see the Titan¡¯s head. ¡°The Braavosi feed him on the juicy pink flesh of little highborn girls,¡± she heard Old Nan say again, but she was not a little girl, and she would not be frightened of a stupid statue. 
¡¡¡¡Even so, she kept one hand on Needle as they slipped between his legs. More arrow slits dotted the insides of those great stone thighs, and when Arya craned her neck around to watch the crow¡¯s nest slip through with a good ten yards to spare, she spied murder holes beneath the Titan¡¯s armored skirts, and pale faces staring down at them from behind the iron bars. 
¡¡¡¡And then they were past. 
¡¡¡¡The shadow lifted, the pine-clad ridges fell away to either side, the winds dwindled, and they found themselves moving through a great lagoon. Ahead rose another sea mont, a knob of rock that pushed up from the water like a spiked fist, its stony battlements bristling with scorpions, spitfires, and trebuchets. ¡°The Arsenal of Braavos,¡± Denyo named it, as proud as if he¡¯d built it. ¡°They can build a war galley there in a day.¡± Arya could see dozens of galleys tied up at quays and perched on launching slips. The painted prows of others poked from innumerable wooden sheds along the stony shores, like hounds in a kennel, lean and mean and hungry, waiting for a hunter¡¯s horn to call them forth. She tried to count them, but there were too many, and more docks and sheds and quays where the shoreline curved away. 
¡¡¡¡Two galleys had come out to meet them. They seemed to skim upon the water like dragonflies, their pale oars flashing. Arya heard the captain shouting to them and their own captains shouting back, but she did not understand the words. A great horn sounded. The galleys passed to either side of them, so close that she could hear the muffled sound of drums from within their purple hulls, bom bom bom bom bom bom bom bom, like the beat of living hearts. 
¡¡¡¡Then the galleys were behind them, and the Arsenal as well. Ahead stretched a broad expanse of pea-green water rippled like a sheet of colored glass. From its wet heart arose the city proper, a great sprawl of domes and towers and bridges, grey and gold and red. 
¡¡¡¡The hundred isles of Braavos in the sea. 
¡¡¡¡Maester Luwin had taught them about Braavos, but Arya had forgotten much of what he¡¯d said. It was a flat city, she could see that even from afar, not like King¡¯s Landing on its three high hills. The only hills here were the ones that men had raised of brick and granite, bronze and marble. Something else was missing as well, though it took her a few moments to realize what it was. The city has no walls. But when she said as much to Denyo, he laughed at her. ¡°Our walls are made of wood and painted purple,¡± he told her. ¡°Our galleys are our walls. We need no other.¡± 
¡¡¡¡The deck creaked behind them. Arya turned to find Denyo¡¯s father looming over them in his long captain¡¯s coat of purple wool. Tradesman-Captain Ternesio Terys wore no whiskers and kept his grey hair cut short and neat, framing his square, windburnt face. On the crossing she had oft seen him jesting with his crew, but when he frowned men ran from him as if before a storm. He was frowning now. ¡°Our voyage is at an end,¡± he told Arya. ¡°We make for the Chequy Port, where the Sealord¡¯s customs officers will come aboard to inspect our holds. They will be half a day at it, they always are, but there is no need for you to wait upon their pleasure. Gather your belongings. I shall lower a boat, and Yorko will put you ashore.¡± 
¡¡¡¡Ashore. Arya bit her lip. She had crossed the narrow sea to get here, but if the captain had asked she would have told him she wanted to stay aboard the Titan¡¯s Daughter. Salty was too small to man an oar, she knew that now, but she could learn to splice ropes and reef the sails and steer a course across the great salt seas. Denyo had taken her up to the crow¡¯s nest once, and she hadn¡¯t been afraid at all, though the deck had seemed a tiny thing below her. I can do sums too, and keep a cabin neat. 
¡¡¡¡But the galleas had no need of a second boy. Besides, she had only to look at the captain¡¯s face to know how anxious he was to be rid of her. So Arya only nodded. ¡°Ashore,¡± she said, though ashore meant only strangers. 
¡¡¡¡¡°Valar dohaeris.¡± He touched two fingers to his brow. ¡°I beg you remember Ternesio Terys and the service he has done you.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°I will,¡± Arya said in a small voice. The wind tugged at her cloak, insistent as a ghost. It was time she was away. 
¡¡¡¡Gather your belongings, the captain had said, but there were few enough of those. Only the clothes she was wearing, her little pouch of coins, the gifts the crew had given her, the dagger on her left hip and Needle on her right. The boat was ready before she was, and Yorko was at the oars. He was the captain¡¯s son as well, but older than Denyo and less friendly. I never said farewell to Denyo, she thought as she clambered down to join him. She wondered if she would ever see the boy again. I should have said farewell. 
¡¡¡¡The Titan¡¯s Daughter dwindled in their wake, while the city grew larger with every stroke of Yorko¡¯s oars. A harbor was visible off to her right, a tangle of piers and quays crowded with big-bellied whalers out of Ibben, swan ships from the Summer Isles, and more galleys than a girl could count. Another harbor, more distant, was off to her left, beyond a sinking point of land where the tops of half-drowned buildings thrust themselves above the water. Arya had never seen so many big buildings all together in one place. King¡¯s Landing had the Red Keep and the Great Sept of Baelor and the Dragonpit, but Braavos seemed to boast a score of temples and towers and palaces that were as large or even larger. I will be a mouse again, she thought glumly, the way I was in Harrenhal before I ran away. 
¡¡¡¡The city had seemed like one big island from where the Titan stood, but as Yorko rowed them closer she saw that it was many small islands close together, linked by arched stone bridges that spanned innumerable canals. Beyond the harbor she glimpsed streets of grey stone houses, built so close they leaned one upon the other. To Arya¡¯s eyes they were queer-looking, four and five stories tall and very skinny, with sharp-peaked tile roofs like pointed hats. She saw no thatch, and only a few timbered houses of the sort she knew in Westeros. They have no trees, she realized. Braavos is all stone, a grey city in a green sea. 
¡¡¡¡Yorko swung them north of the docks and down the gullet of a great canal, a broad green waterway that ran straight into the heart of the city. They passed under the arches of a carved stone bridge, decorated with half a hundred kinds of fish and crabs and squids. A second bridge appeared ahead, this one carved in lacy leafy vines, and beyond that a third, gazing down on them from a thousand painted eyes. The mouths of lesser canals opened to either side, and others still smaller off of those. Some of the houses were built above the waterways, she saw, turning the canals into a sort of tunnel. Slender boats slid in and out among them, wrought in the shapes of water serpents with painted heads and upraised tails. Those were not rowed but poled, she saw, by men who stood at their sterns in cloaks of grey and brown and deep moss green. She saw huge flat-bottomed barges too, heaped high with crates and barrels and pushed along by twenty polemen to a side, and fancy floating houses with lanterns of colored glass, velvet drapes, and brazen figureheads. Off in the far distance, looming above canals and houses both, was a massive grey stone roadway of some kind, supported by three tiers of mighty arches marching away south into the haze. ¡°What¡¯s that?¡± Arya asked Yorko, pointing. ¡°The sweetwater river,¡± he told her. ¡°It brings fresh water from the mainland, across the mudflats and the briny shallows. Good sweet water for the fountains.¡± 
¡¡¡¡When she looked behind her, the harbor and lagoon were lost to sight. Ahead, a row of mighty statues stood along both sides of the channel, solemn stone men in long bronze robes, spattered with the droppings of the seabirds. Some held books, some daggers, some hammers. One clutched a golden star in his upraised hand. Another was upending a stone flagon to send an endless stream of water splashing down into the canal. ¡°Are they gods?¡± asked Arya. 
¡¡¡¡¡°Sealords,¡± said Yorko. ¡°The Isle of the Gods is farther on. See? Six bridges down, on the right bank. That is the Temple of the Moonsingers.¡± 
¡¡¡¡It was one of those that Arya had spied from the lagoon, a mighty mass of snow-white marble topped by a huge silvered dome whose milk glass windows showed all the phases of the moon. A pair of marble maidens flanked its gates, tall as the Sealords, supporting a crescent-shaped lintel. 
¡¡¡¡Beyond it stood another temple, a red stone edifice as stern as any fortress. Atop its great square tower a fire blazed in an iron brazier twenty feet across, whilst smaller fires flanked its brazen doors. ¡°The red priests love their fires,¡± Yorko told her. ¡°The Lord of Light is their god, red R¡¯hllor.¡± 
¡¡¡¡I know. Arya remembered Thoros of Myr in his bits of old armor, worn over robes so faded that he had seemed more a pink priest than a red one. Yet his kiss had brought Lord Beric back from death. She watched the red god¡¯s house drift by, wondering whether these Braavosi priests of his could do the same. 
¡¡¡¡Next came a huge brick structure festooned with lichen. Arya might have taken it for a storehouse had not Yorko said, ¡°That is the Holy Refuge, where we honor the small gods the world has forgotten. You will hear it called the Warren too.¡± A small canal ran between the Warren¡¯s looming lichen-covered walls, and there he swung them right. They passed through a tunnel and out again into the light. More shrines loomed up to either side. 
¡¡¡¡¡°I never knew there were so many gods,¡± Arya said. 
¡¡¡¡Yorko grunted. They went around a bend and beneath another bridge. On their left appeared a rocky knoll with a windowless temple of dark grey stone at its top. A flight of stone steps led from its doors down to a covered dock. 
¡¡¡¡Yorko backed the oars, and the boat bumped gently against stone pilings. He grasped an iron ring set to hold them for a moment. ¡°Here I leave you.¡± 
¡¡¡¡The dock was shadowed, the steps steep. The temple¡¯s black tile roof came to a sharp peak, like the houses along the canals. Arya chewed her lip. Syrio came from Braavos. He might have visited this temple. He might have climbed those steps. She grabbed a ring and pulled herself up onto the dock. 
¡¡¡¡¡°You know my name,¡± said Yorko from the boat. 
¡¡¡¡¡°Yorko Terys.¡± ¡°Valar dohaeris.¡± He pushed off with his oar and drifted back off into the deeper water. Arya watched him row back the way they¡¯d come, until he vanished in the shadows of the bridge. As the swish of oars faded, she could almost hear the beating of her heart. Suddenly she was somewhere else . . . back in Harrenhal with Gendry, maybe, or with the Hound in the woods along the Trident. Salty is a stupid child, she told herself. I am a wolf, and will not be afraid. She patted Needle¡¯s hilt for luck and plunged into the shadows, taking the steps two at a time so no one could ever say she¡¯d been afraid. 
¡¡¡¡At the top she found a set of carved wooden doors twelve feet high. The left-hand door was made of weirwood pale as bone, the right of gleaming ebony. In their center was a carved moon face; ebony on the weirwood side, weirwood on the ebony. The look of it reminded her somehow of the heart tree in the godswood at Winterfell. The doors are watching me, she thought. She pushed upon both doors at once with the flat of her gloved hands, but neither one would budge. Locked and barred. ¡°Let me in, you stupid,¡± she said. ¡°I crossed the narrow sea.¡± She made a fist and pounded. ¡°Jaqen told me to come. I have the iron coin.¡± She pulled it from her pouch and held it up. ¡°See? Valar morghulis.¡± 
¡¡¡¡The doors made no reply, except to open. 
¡¡¡¡They opened inward all in silence, with no human hand to move them. Arya took a step forward, and another. The doors closed behind her, and for a moment she was blind. Needle was in her hand, though she did not remember drawing it. 
¡¡¡¡A few candles burned along the walls, but gave so little light that Arya could not see her own feet. Someone was whispering, too softly for her to make out words. Someone else was weeping. She heard light footfalls, leather sliding over stone, a door opening and closing. Water, I hear water too. 
¡¡¡¡Slowly her eyes adjusted. The temple seemed much larger within than it had without. The septs of Westeros were seven-sided, with seven altars for the seven gods, but here there were more gods than seven. Statues of them stood along the walls, massive and threatening. Around their feet red candles flickered, as dim as distant stars. The nearest was a marble woman twelve feet tall. Real tears were trickling from her eyes, to fill the bowl she cradled in her arms. Beyond her was a man with a lion¡¯s head seated on a throne, carved of ebony. On the other side of the doors, a huge horse of bronze and iron reared up on two great legs. Farther on she could make out a great stone face, a pale infant with a sword, a shaggy black goat the size of an aurochs, a hooded man leaning on a staff. The rest were only looming shapes to her, half-seen through the gloom. Between the gods were hidden alcoves thick with shadows, with here and there a candle burning. 
¡¡¡¡Silent as a shadow, Arya moved between rows of long stone benches, her sword in hand. The floor was made of stone, her feet told her; not polished marble like the floor of the Great Sept of Baelor, but something rougher. She passed some women whispering together. The air was warm and heavy, so heavy that she yawned. She could smell the candles. The scent was unfamiliar, and she put it down to some queer incense, but as she got deeper into the temple, they seemed to smell of snow and pine needles and hot stew. Good smells, Arya told herself, and felt a little braver. Brave enough to slip Needle back into its sheath. 
¡¡¡¡In the center of the temple she found the water she had heard; a pool ten feet across, black as ink and lit by dim red candles. Beside it sat a young man in a silvery cloak, weeping softly. She watched him dip a hand in the water, sending scarlet ripples racing across the pool. When he drew his fingers back he sucked them, one by one. He must be thirsty. There were stone cups along the rim of the pool. Arya filled one and brought it to him, so he could drink. The young man stared at her for a long moment when she offered it to him. ¡°Valar morghulis,¡± he said. 
¡¡¡¡¡°Valar dohaeris,¡± she replied. 
¡¡¡¡He drank deep, and dropped the cup into the pool with a soft plop. Then he pushed himself to his feet, swaying, holding his belly. For a moment Arya thought he was going to fall. It was only then that she saw the dark stain below his belt, spreading as she watched. ¡°You¡¯re stabbed,¡± she blurted, but the man paid her no mind. He lurched unsteadily toward the wall and crawled into an alcove onto a hard stone bed. When Arya peered around, she saw other alcoves too. On some there were old people sleeping. 
¡¡¡¡No, a half-remembered voice seemed to whisper in her head. They are dead, or dying. Look with your eyes. 
¡¡¡¡A hand touched her arm. 
¡¡¡¡Arya spun away, but it was only a little girl: a pale little girl in a cowled robe that seemed to engulf her, black on the right side and white on the left. Beneath the cowl was a gaunt and bony face, hollow cheeks, and dark eyes that looked as big as saucers. ¡°Don¡¯t grab me,¡± Arya warned the waif. ¡°I killed the boy who grabbed me last.¡± 
¡¡¡¡The girl said some words that Arya did not know. 
¡¡¡¡She shook her head. ¡°Don¡¯t you know the Common Tongue?¡± 
¡¡¡¡A voice behind her said, ¡°I do.¡± 
¡¡¡¡Arya did not like the way they kept surprising her. The hooded man was tall, enveloped in a larger version of the black-and-white robe the girl was wearing. Beneath his cowl all she could see was the faint red glitter of candlelight reflecting off his eyes. ¡°What place is this?¡± she asked him. 
¡¡¡¡¡°A place of peace.¡± His voice was gentle. ¡°You are safe here. This is the House of Black and White, my child. Though you are young to seek the favor of the Many-Faced God.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Is he like the southron god, the one with seven faces?¡± ¡°Seven? No. He has faces beyond count, little one, as many faces as there are stars in the sky. In Braavos, men worship as they will . . . but at the end of every road stands Him of Many Faces, waiting. He will be there for you one day, do not fear. You need not rush to his embrace.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°I only came to find Jaqen H¡¯ghar.¡± ¡°I do not know this name.¡± Her heart sank. ¡°He was from Lorath. His hair was white on one side and red on the 
¡¡¡¡other. He said he¡¯d teach me secrets, and gave me this.¡± The iron coin was clutched in her 
¡¡¡¡fist. When she opened her fingers, it clung to her sweaty palm. The priest studied the coin, though he made no move to touch it. The waif with the big eyes was looking at it too. Finally, the cowled man said, ¡°Tell me your name, child.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Salty. I come from Saltpans, by the Trident.¡± 
¡¡¡¡Though she could not see his face, somehow she could feel him smiling. ¡°No,¡± he said. ¡°Tell me your name.¡± ¡°Squab,¡± she answered this time. ¡°Your true name, child.¡± ¡°My mother named me Nan, but they call me Weasel¡ª¡± ¡°Your name.¡± She swallowed. ¡°Arry. I¡¯m Arry.¡± ¡°Closer. And now the truth?¡± Fear cuts deeper than swords, she told herself. ¡°Arya.¡± She whispered the word the first 
¡¡¡¡time. The second time she threw it at him. ¡°I am Arya, of House Stark.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°You are,¡± he said, ¡°but the House of Black and White is no place for Arya, of House Stark.¡± ¡°Please,¡± she said. ¡°I have no place to go.¡± ¡°Do you fear death?¡± She bit her lip. ¡°No.¡± ¡°Let us see.¡± The priest lowered his cowl. Beneath he had no face; only a yellowed skull with a few scraps of skin still clinging to the cheeks, and a white worm wriggling from one empty eye socket. ¡°Kiss me, child,¡± he croaked, in a voice as dry and husky as a death rattle. 
¡¡¡¡Does he think to scare me? Arya kissed him where his nose should be and plucked the grave worm from his eye to eat it, but it melted like a shadow in her hand. 
¡¡¡¡The yellow skull was melting too, and the kindliest old man that she had ever seen was smiling down at her. ¡°No one has ever tried to eat my worm before,¡± he said. ¡°Are you hungry, child?¡± 
¡¡¡¡Yes, she thought, but not for food. 
¡¡¡¡CERSEI 
¡¡¡¡A cold rain was falling, turning the walls and ramparts of the Red Keep dark as blood. The queen held the king¡¯s hand and led him firmly across the muddy yard to where her litter waited with its escort. ¡°Uncle Jaime said I could ride my horse and throw pennies to the smallfolk,¡± the boy objected. 
¡¡¡¡¡°Do you want to catch a chill?¡± She would not risk it; Tommen had never been as robust as Joffrey. ¡°Your grandfather would want you to look a proper king at his wake. We will not appear at the Great Sept wet and bedraggled.¡± Bad enough I must wear mourning again. Black had never been a happy color on her. With her fair skin, it made her look half a corpse herself. Cersei had risen an hour before dawn to bathe and fix her hair, and she did not intend to let the rain destroy her efforts. 
¡¡¡¡Inside the litter, Tommen settled back against his pillows and peered out at the falling rain. ¡°The gods are weeping for grandfather. Lady Jocelyn says the raindrops are their tears.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Jocelyn Swyft is a fool. If the gods could weep, they would have wept for your brother. Rain is rain. Close the curtain before you let any more in. That mantle is sable, would you have it soaked?¡± 
¡¡¡¡Tommen did as he was bid. His meekness troubled her. A king had to be strong. Joffrey would have argued. He was never easy to cow. ¡°Don¡¯t slump so,¡± she told Tommen. ¡°Sit like a king. Put your shoulders back and straighten your crown. Do you want it to tumble off your head in front of all your lords?¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°No, Mother.¡± The boy sat straight and reached up to fix the crown. Joff¡¯s crown was too big for him. Tommen had always inclined to plumpness, but his face seemed thinner now. Is he eating well? She must remember to ask the steward. She could not risk Tommen growing ill, not with Myrcella in the hands of the Dornishmen. He will grow into Joff¡¯s crown in time. Until he did, a smaller one might be needed, one that did not threaten to swallow his head. She would take it up with the goldsmiths. 
¡¡¡¡The litter made its slow way down Aegon¡¯s High Hill. Two Kingsguard rode before them, white knights on white horses with white cloaks hanging sodden from their shoulders. Behind came fifty Lannister guardsmen in gold and crimson. 
¡¡¡¡Tommen peered through the drapes at the empty streets. ¡°I thought there would be more people. When Father died, all the people came out to watch us go by.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°This rain has driven them inside.¡± King¡¯s Landing had never loved Lord Tywin. He never wanted love, though. ¡°You cannot eat love, nor buy a horse with it, nor warm your halls on a cold night,¡± she heard him tell Jaime once, when her brother had been no older than Tommen. 
¡¡¡¡At the Great Sept of Baelor, that magnificence in marble atop Visenya¡¯s Hill, the little knot of mourners were outnumbered by the gold cloaks that Ser Addam Marbrand had drawn up across the plaza. More will turn out later, the queen told herself as Ser Meryn Trant helped her from the litter. Only the highborn and their retinues were to be admitted to the morning service; there would be another in the afternoon for the commons, and the evening prayers were open to all. Cersei would need to return for that, so that the smallfolk might see her mourn. The mob must have its show. It was a nuisance. She had offices to fill, a war to win, a realm to rule. Her father would have understood that. 
¡¡¡¡The High Septon met them at the top of the steps. A bent old man with a wispy grey beard, he was so stooped by the weight of his ornate embroidered robes that his eyes were on a level with the queen¡¯s breasts . . . though his crown, an airy confection of cut crystal and spun gold, added a good foot and a half to his height. 
¡¡¡¡Lord Tywin had given him that crown to replace the one that was lost when the mob killed the previous High Septon. They had pulled the fat fool from his litter and torn him apart, the day Myrcella sailed for Dorne. That one was a great glutton, and biddable. This one . . . This High Septon was of Tyrion¡¯s making, Cersei recalled suddenly. It was a disquieting thought. 
¡¡¡¡The old man¡¯s spotted hand looked like a chicken claw as it poked from a sleeve encrusted with golden scrollwork and small crystals. Cersei knelt on the wet marble and kissed his fingers, and bid Tommen to do the same. What does he know of me? How much did the dwarf tell him? The High Septon smiled as he escorted her into the sept. But was it a threatening smile full of unspoken knowledge, or just some vacuous twitch of an old man¡¯s wrinkled lips? The queen could not be certain. 
¡¡¡¡They made their way through the Hall of Lamps beneath colored globes of leaded glass, Tommen¡¯s hand in hers. Trant and Kettleblack flanked them, water dripping from their wet cloaks to puddle on the floor. The High Septon walked slowly, leaning on a weirwood staff topped by a crystal orb. Seven of the Most Devout attended him, shimmering in cloth-of-silver. Tommen wore cloth-of-gold beneath his sable mantle, the queen an old gown of black velvet lined with ermine. There¡¯d been no time to have a new one made, and she could not wear the same dress she had worn for Joffrey, nor the one she¡¯d buried Robert in. 
¡¡¡¡At least I will not be expected to don mourning for Tyrion. I shall dress in crimson silk and cloth-of-gold for that, and wear rubies in my hair. The man who brought her the dwarf¡¯s head would be raised to lordship, she had proclaimed, no matter how mean and low his birth or station. Ravens were carrying her promise to every part of the Seven Kingdoms, and soon enough word would cross the narrow sea to the Nine Free Cities and the lands beyond. Let the Imp run to the ends of the earth, he will not escape me. 
¡¡¡¡The royal procession passed through the inner doors into the cavernous heart of the Great Sept, and down a wide aisle, one of seven that met beneath the dome. To right and left, highborn mourners sank to their knees as the king and queen went by. Many of her father¡¯s bannermen were here, and knights who had fought beside Lord Tywin in half a hundred battles. The sight of them made her feel more confident. I am not without friends. 
¡¡¡¡Under the Great Sept¡¯s lofty dome of glass and gold and crystal, Lord Tywin Lannister¡¯s body rested upon a stepped marble bier. At its head Jaime stood at vigil, his one good hand curled about the hilt of a tall golden greatsword whose point rested on the floor. The hooded cloak he wore was as white as freshly fallen snow, and the scales of his long hauberk were mother-of-pearl chased with gold. Lord Tywin would have wanted him in Lannister gold and crimson, she thought. It always angered him to see Jaime all in white. Her brother was growing his beard again as well. The stubble covered his jaw and cheeks, and gave his face a rough, uncouth look. He might at least have waited till Father¡¯s bones were interred beneath the Rock. 
¡¡¡¡Cersei led the king up three short steps, to kneel beside the body. Tommen¡¯s eyes were filled with tears. ¡°Weep quietly,¡± she told him, leaning close. ¡°You are a king, not a squalling child. Your lords are watching you.¡± The boy swiped the tears away with the back of his hand. He had her eyes, emerald green, as large and bright as Jaime¡¯s eyes had been when he was Tommen¡¯s age. Her brother had been such a pretty boy . . . but fierce as well, as fierce as Joffrey, a true lion cub. The queen put her arm around Tommen and kissed his golden curls. He will need me to teach him how to rule and keep him safe from his enemies. Some of them stood around them even now, pretending to be friends. The silent sisters had armored Lord Tywin as if to fight some final battle. He wore his finest plate, heavy steel enameled a deep, dark crimson, with gold inlay on his gauntlets, greaves, and breastplate. His rondels were golden sunbursts; a golden lioness crouched upon each shoulder; a maned lion crested the greathelm beside his head. Upon his chest lay a longsword in a gilded scabbard studded with rubies, his hands folded about its hilt in gloves of gilded mail. Even in death his face is noble, she thought, although the mouth . . . The corners of her father¡¯s lips curved upward ever so slightly, giving him a look of vague bemusement. That should not be. She blamed Pycelle; he should have told the silent sisters that Lord Tywin Lannister never smiled. The man is as useless as nipples on a breastplate. That half smile made Lord Tywin seem less fearful, somehow. That, and the fact that his eyes were closed. Her father¡¯s eyes had always been unsettling; pale green, almost luminous, flecked with gold. His eyes could see inside you, could see how weak and worthless and ugly you were down deep. When he looked at you, you knew. 
¡¡¡¡Unbidden, a memory came to her, of the feast King Aerys had thrown when Cersei first came to court, a girl as green as summer grass. Old Merryweather had been nattering about raising the duty on wine when Lord Rykker said, ¡°If we need gold, His Grace should sit Lord Tywin on his chamber pot.¡± Aerys and his lickspittles laughed loudly, whilst Father stared at Rykker over his wine cup. Long after the merriment had died that gaze had lingered. Rykker turned away, turned back, met Father¡¯s eyes, then ignored them, drank a tankard of ale, and stalked off red-faced, defeated by a pair of unflinching eyes. 
¡¡¡¡Lord Tywin¡¯s eyes are closed forever now, Cersei thought. It is my look they will flinch from now, my frown that they must fear. I am a lion too. 
¡¡¡¡It was gloomy within the sept with the sky so grey outside. If the rain ever stopped, the sun would slant down through the hanging crystals to drape the corpse in rainbows. The Lord of Casterly Rock deserved rainbows. He had been a great man. I shall be greater, though. A thousand years from now, when the maesters write about this time, you shall be remembered only as Queen Cersei¡¯s sire. 
¡¡¡¡¡°Mother.¡± Tommen tugged her sleeve. ¡°What smells so bad?¡± 
¡¡¡¡My lord father. ¡°Death.¡± She could smell it too; a faint whisper of decay that made her want to wrinkle her nose. Cersei paid it no mind. The seven septons in the silver robes stood behind the bier, beseeching the Father Above to judge Lord Tywin justly. When they were done, seventy-seven septas gathered before the altar of the Mother and began to sing to her for mercy. Tommen was fidgeting by then, and even the queen¡¯s knees had begun to ache. She glanced at Jaime. Her twin stood as if he had been carved from stone, and would not meet her eyes. 
¡¡¡¡On the benches, their uncle Kevan knelt with his shoulders slumped, his son beside him. Lancel looks worse than Father. Though only seventeen, he might have passed for seventy; grey-faced, gaunt, with hollow cheeks, sunken eyes, and hair as white and brittle as chalk. How can Lancel be among the living when Tywin Lannister is dead? Have the gods taken leave of their wits? 
¡¡¡¡Lord Gyles was coughing more than usual and covering his nose with a square of red silk. He can smell it too. Grand Maester Pycelle had his eyes closed. If he has fallen asleep, I swear I will have him whipped. To the right of the bier knelt the Tyrells: the Lord of Highgarden, his hideous mother and vapid wife, his son Garlan and his daughter Margaery. Queen Margaery, she reminded herself; Joff¡¯s widow and Tommen¡¯s wife-tobe. Margaery looked very like her brother, the Knight of Flowers. The queen wondered if they had other things in common. Our little rose has a good many ladies waiting attendance on her, night and day. They were with her now, almost a dozen of them. Cersei studied their faces, wondering. Who is the most fearful, the most wanton, the hungriest for favor? Who has the loosest tongue? She would need to make a point of finding out. 
¡¡¡¡It was a relief when the singing finally ended. The smell coming off her father¡¯s corpse seemed to have grown stronger. Most of the mourners had the decency to pretend that nothing was amiss, but Cersei saw two of Lady Margaery¡¯s cousins wrinkling their little Tyrell noses. As she and Tommen were walking back down the aisle the queen thought she heard someone mutter ¡°privy¡± and chortle, but when she turned her head to see who had spoken a sea of solemn faces gazed at her blankly. They would never have dared make japes about him when he was still alive. He would have turned their bowels to water with a look. 
¡¡¡¡Back out in the Hall of Lamps, the mourners buzzed about them thick as flies, eager to shower her with useless condolences. The Redwyne twins both kissed her hand, their father her cheeks. Hallyne the Pyromancer promised her that a flaming hand would burn in the sky above the city on the day her father¡¯s bones went west. Between coughs, Lord Gyles told her that he had hired a master stonecarver to make a statue of Lord Tywin, to stand eternal vigil beside the Lion Gate. Ser Lambert Turnberry appeared with a patch over his right eye, swearing that he would wear it until he could bring her the head of her dwarf brother. 
¡¡¡¡No sooner had the queen escaped the clutches of that fool than she found herself cornered by Lady Falyse of Stokeworth and her husband, Ser Balman Byrch. ¡°My lady mother sends her regrets, Your Grace,¡± Falyse burbled at her. ¡°Lollys has been taken to bed with the child and she felt the need to stay with her. She begs that you forgive her, and said I should ask you . . . my mother admired your late father above all other men. Should my sister have a little boy, it is her wish that we might name him Tywin, if . . . if it please you.¡± 
¡¡¡¡Cersei stared at her, aghast. ¡°Your lackwit sister gets herself raped by half of King¡¯s Landing, and Tanda thinks to honor the bastard with my lord father¡¯s name? I think not.¡± Falyse flinched back as if she¡¯d been slapped, but her husband only stroked his thick blond mustache with a thumb. ¡°I told Lady Tanda as much. We shall find a more, ah . . . a more fitting name for Lollys¡¯s bastard, you have my word.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°See that you do.¡± Cersei showed them a shoulder and moved away. Tommen had fallen into the clutches of Margaery Tyrell and her grandmother, she saw. The Queen of Thorns was so short that for an instant Cersei took her for another child. Before she could rescue her son from the roses, the press brought her face-to-face with her uncle. When the queen reminded him of their meeting later, Ser Kevan gave a weary nod and begged leave to withdraw. But Lancel lingered, the very picture of a man with one foot in the grave. But is he climbing in or climbing out? 
¡¡¡¡Cersei forced herself to smile. ¡°Lancel, I am happy to see you looking so much stronger. Maester Ballabar brought us such dire reports, we feared for your life. But I would have thought you on your way to Darry by now, to take up your lordship.¡± Her father had made Lancel a lord after the Battle of the Blackwater, as a sop to his brother Kevan. 
¡¡¡¡¡°Not as yet. There are outlaws in my castle.¡± Her cousin¡¯s voice was as wispy as the mustache on his upper lip. Though his hair had gone white, his mustache fuzz remained a sandy color. Cersei had often gazed up at it while the boy was inside her, pumping dutifully away. It looks like a smudge of dirt on his lip. She used to threaten to scrub it off with a little spit. ¡°The riverlands have need of a strong hand, my father says.¡± 
¡¡¡¡A pity that they¡¯re getting yours, she wanted to say. Instead she smiled. ¡°And you are to be wed as well.¡± 
¡¡¡¡A gloomy look passed across the young knight¡¯s ravaged face. ¡°A Frey girl, and not of my choosing. She is not even maiden. A widow, of Darry blood. My father says that will help me with the peasants, but the peasants are all dead.¡± He reached for her hand. ¡°It is cruel, Cersei. Your Grace knows that I love¡ª¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°¡ªHouse Lannister,¡± she finished for him. ¡°No one can doubt that, Lancel. May your wife give you strong sons.¡± Best not let her lord grandfather host the wedding, though. ¡°I know you will do many noble deeds in Darry.¡± 
¡¡¡¡Lancel nodded, plainly miserable. ¡°When it seemed that I might die, my father brought the High Septon to pray for me. He is a good man.¡± Her cousin¡¯s eyes were wet and shiny, a child¡¯s eyes in an old man¡¯s face. ¡°He says the Mother spared me for some holy purpose, so I might atone for my sins.¡± 
¡¡¡¡Cersei wondered how he intended to atone for her. Knighting him was a mistake, and bedding him a bigger one. Lancel was a weak reed, and she liked his newfound piety not at all; he had been much more amusing when he was trying to be Jaime. What has this mewling fool told the High Septon? And what will he tell his little Frey when they lie together in the dark? If he confessed to bedding Cersei, well, she could weather that. Men were always lying about women; she would put it down as the braggadocio of a callow boy smitten by her beauty. If he sings of Robert and the strongwine, though . . . ¡°Atonement is best achieved through prayer,¡± Cersei told him. ¡°Silent prayer.¡± She left him to think about that and girded herself to face the Tyrell host. 
¡¡¡¡Margaery embraced her like a sister, which the queen found presumptuous, but this was not the place to reproach her. Lady Alerie and the cousins contented themselves with kissing fingers. Lady Graceford, who was large with child, asked the queen¡¯s leave to name it Tywin if it were a boy, or Lanna if it were a girl. Another one? she almost groaned. The realm will drown in Tywins. She gave consent as graciously as she could, feigning delight. 
¡¡¡¡It was Lady Merryweather who truly pleased her. ¡°Your Grace,¡± that one said, in her sultry Myrish tones, ¡°I have sent word to my friends across the narrow sea, asking them to seize the Imp at once should he show his ugly face in the Free Cities.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Do you have many friends across the water?¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°In Myr, many. In Lys as well, and Tyrosh. Men of power.¡± 
¡¡¡¡Cersei could well believe it. The Myrish woman was too beautiful by half; long-legged and full-breasted, with smooth olive skin, ripe lips, huge dark eyes, and thick black hair that always looked as if she¡¯d just come from bed. She even smells of sin, like some exotic lotus. ¡°Lord Merryweather and I wish only to serve Your Grace and the little king,¡± the woman purred, with a look that was as pregnant as Lady Graceford. 
¡¡¡¡This one is ambitious, and her lord is proud but poor. ¡°We must speak again, my lady. Taena, is it? You are most kind. I know that we shall be great friends.¡± 
¡¡¡¡Then the Lord of Highgarden descended on her. 
¡¡¡¡Mace Tyrell was no more than ten years older than Cersei, yet she thought of him as her father¡¯s age, not her own. He was not quite so tall as Lord Tywin had been, but elsewise he was bigger, with a thick chest and a gut grown even thicker. His hair was chestnut-colored, but there were specks of white and grey in his beard. His face was often red. ¡°Lord Tywin was a great man, an extraordinary man,¡± he declared ponderously after he had kissed both her cheeks. ¡°We shall never see his like again, I fear.¡± 
¡¡¡¡You are looking at his like, fool, Cersei thought. It is his daughter standing here before you. But she needed Tyrell and the strength of Highgarden to keep Tommen on his throne, so all she said was, ¡°He will be greatly missed.¡± 
¡¡¡¡Tyrell put a hand upon her shoulder. ¡°No man alive is fit to don Lord Tywin¡¯s armor, that is plain. Still, the realm goes on, and must be ruled. If there is aught that I might do to serve in this dark hour, Your Grace need only ask.¡± If you want to be the King¡¯s Hand, my lord, have the courage to say it plainly. The queen smiled. Let him read into that as much as he likes. ¡°Surely my lord is needed in the Reach?¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°My son Willas is an able lad,¡± the man replied, refusing to take her perfectly good hint. ¡°His leg may be twisted but he has no want of wits. And Garlan will soon take Brightwater. Between them the Reach will be in good hands, if it happens that I am needed elsewhere. The governance of the realm must come first, Lord Tywin often said. And I am pleased to bring Your Grace good tidings in that regard. My uncle Garth has agreed to serve as master of coin, as your lord father wished. He is making his way to Oldtown to take ship. His sons will accompany him. Lord Tywin mentioned something about finding places for the two of them as well. Perhaps in the City Watch.¡± 
¡¡¡¡The queen¡¯s smile had frozen so hard she feared her teeth might crack. Garth the Gross on the small council and his two bastards in the gold cloaks . . . do the Tyrells think I will just serve the realm up to them on a gilded platter? The arrogance of it took her breath away. 
¡¡¡¡¡°Garth has served me well as Lord Seneschal, as he served my father before me,¡± Tyrell was going on. ¡°Littlefinger had a nose for gold, I grant you, but Garth¡ª¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°My lord,¡± Cersei broke in, ¡°I fear there has been some misunderstanding. I have asked Lord Gyles Rosby to serve as our new master of coin, and he has done me the honor of accepting.¡± 
¡¡¡¡Mace gaped at her. ¡°Rosby? That . . . cougher? But . . . the matter was agreed, Your Grace. Garth is on his way to Oldtown.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Best send a raven to Lord Hightower and ask him to make certain your uncle does not take ship. We would hate for Garth to brave an autumn sea for nought.¡± She smiled pleasantly. 
¡¡¡¡A flush crept up Tyrell¡¯s thick neck. ¡°This . . . your lord father assured me . . .¡± He began to sputter. 
¡¡¡¡Then his mother appeared and slid her arm through his own. ¡°It would seem that Lord Tywin did not share his plans with our regent, I can¡¯t imagine why. Still, there ¡¯tis, no use hectoring Her Grace. She is quite right, you must write Lord Leyton before Garth boards a ship. You know the sea will sicken him and make his farting worse.¡± Lady Olenna gave Cersei a toothless smile. ¡°Your council chambers will smell sweeter with Lord Gyles, though I daresay that coughing would drive me to distraction. We all adore dear old uncle Garth, but the man is flatulent, that cannot be gainsaid. I do abhor foul smells.¡± Her wrinkled face wrinkled up even more. ¡°I caught a whiff of something unpleasant in the holy sept, in truth. Mayhaps you smelled it too?¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°No,¡± Cersei said coldly. ¡°A scent, you say?¡± ¡°More like a stink.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Perhaps you miss your autumn roses. We have kept you here too long.¡± The sooner she rid the court of Lady Olenna the better. Lord Tyrell would doubtless dispatch a goodly number of knights to see his mother safely home, and the fewer Tyrell swords in the city, the more soundly the queen would sleep. 
¡¡¡¡¡°I do long for the fragrances of Highgarden, I confess it,¡± said the old lady, ¡°but of course I cannot leave until I have seen my sweet Margaery wed to your precious little Tommen.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°I await that day eagerly as well,¡± Tyrell put in. ¡°Lord Tywin and I were on the point of setting a date, as it happens. Perhaps you and I might take up that discussion, Your Grace.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Soon.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Soon will serve,¡± said Lady Olenna with a sniff. ¡°Now come along, Mace, let Her Grace get on with her . . . grief.¡± 
¡¡¡¡I will see you dead, old woman, Cersei promised herself as the Queen of Thorns tottered off between her towering guardsmen, a pair of seven-footers that it amused her to call Left and Right. We¡¯ll see how sweet a corpse you make. The old woman was twice as clever as her lord son, that was plain. 
¡¡¡¡The queen rescued her son from Margaery and her cousins, and made for the doors. Outside, the rain had finally stopped. The autumn air smelled sweet and fresh. Tommen took his crown off. ¡°Put that back on,¡± Cersei commanded him. 
¡¡¡¡¡°It makes my neck hurt,¡± the boy said, but he did as he was bid. ¡°Will I be married soon? Margaery says that as soon as we¡¯re wed we can go to Highgarden.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°You are not going to Highgarden, but you can ride back to the castle.¡± Cersei beckoned to Ser Meryn Trant. ¡°Bring His Grace a mount, and ask Lord Gyles if he would do me the honor of sharing my litter.¡± Things were moving more quickly than she had anticipated; there was no time to be squandered. 
¡¡¡¡Tommen was happy at the prospect of a ride, and of course Lord Gyles was honored by her invitation . . . though when she asked him to be her master of coin, he began coughing so violently that she feared he might die right then and there. But the Mother was merciful, and Gyles eventually recovered sufficiently to accept, and even began coughing out the names of men he wanted to replace, customs officers and wool factors appointed by Littlefinger, even one of the keepers of the keys. 
¡¡¡¡¡°Name the cow what you will, so long as the milk flows. And should the question arise, you joined the council yesterday.¡± ¡°Yester¡ª¡± A fit of coughing bent him over. ¡°Yesterday. To be sure.¡± Lord Gyles coughed into a square of red silk, as if to hide the blood in his spittle. Cersei pretended not to notice. 
¡¡¡¡When he dies I will find someone else. Perhaps she would recall Littlefinger. The queen could not imagine that Petyr Baelish would be allowed to remain Lord Protector of the Vale for very long, with Lysa Arryn dead. The Vale lords were already stirring, if what Pycelle said was true. Once they take that wretched boy away from him, Lord Petyr will come crawling back. 
¡¡¡¡¡°Your Grace?¡± Lord Gyles coughed, and dabbed his mouth. ¡°Might I . . .¡± He coughed again. ¡°. . . ask who . . .¡± Another series of coughs racked him. ¡°. . . who will be the King¡¯s Hand?¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°My uncle,¡± she replied absently. 
¡¡¡¡It was a relief to see the gates of the Red Keep looming large before her. She gave Tommen over to the charge of his squires and retired gratefully to her own chambers to rest. 
¡¡¡¡No sooner had she eased off her shoes than Jocelyn entered timidly to say that Qyburn was without and craved audience. ¡°Send him in,¡± the queen commanded. A ruler gets no rest. 
¡¡¡¡Qyburn was old, but his hair still had more ash than snow in it, and the laugh lines around his mouth made him look like some little girl¡¯s favorite grandfather. A rather shabby grandfather, though. The collar of his robe was frayed, and one sleeve had been torn and badly sewn. ¡°I must beg Your Grace¡¯s pardon for my appearance,¡± he said. ¡°I have been down in the dungeons making inquiries into the Imp¡¯s escape, as you commanded.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°And what have you discovered?¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°The night that Lord Varys and your brother disappeared, a third man also vanished.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Yes, the gaoler. What of him?¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Rugen was the man¡¯s name. An undergaoler who had charge of the black cells. The chief undergaoler describes him as portly, unshaven, gruff of speech. He held his appointment of the old king, Aerys, and came and went as he pleased. The black cells have not oft been occupied in recent years. The other turnkeys were afraid of him, it seems, but none knew much about him. He had no friends, no kin. Nor did he drink or frequent brothels. His sleeping cell was damp and dreary, and the straw he slept upon was mildewed. His chamber pot was overflowing.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°I know all this.¡± Jaime had examined Rugen¡¯s cell, and Ser Addam¡¯s gold cloaks had examined it again. ¡°Aye, Your Grace,¡± said Qyburn, ¡°but did you know that under that stinking chamber pot was a loose stone, which opened on a small hollow? The sort of place where a man might hide valuables that he did not wish to be discovered?¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Valuables?¡± This was new. ¡°Coin, you mean?¡± She had suspected all along that Tyrion had somehow bought this gaoler. 
¡¡¡¡¡°Beyond a doubt. To be sure, the hole was empty when I found it. No doubt Rugen took his ill-gotten treasure with him when he fled. But as I crouched over the hole with my torch, I saw something glitter, so I scratched in the dirt until I dug it out.¡± Qyburn opened his palm. ¡°A gold coin.¡± 
¡¡¡¡Gold, yes, but the moment Cersei took it she could tell that it was wrong. Too small, she thought, too thin. The coin was old and worn. On one side was a king¡¯s face in profile, on the other side the imprint of a hand. ¡°This is no dragon,¡± she said. 
¡¡¡¡¡°No,¡± Qyburn agreed. ¡°It dates from before the Conquest, Your Grace. The king is Garth the Twelfth, and the hand is the sigil of House Gardener.¡± 
¡¡¡¡Of Highgarden. Cersei closed her hand around the coin. What treachery is this? Mace Tyrell had been one of Tyrion¡¯s judges, and had called loudly for his death. Was that some ploy? Could he have been plotting with the Imp all the while, conspiring at Father¡¯s death? With Tywin Lannister in his grave, Lord Tyrell was an obvious choice to be King¡¯s Hand, but even so . . . ¡°You will not speak of this with anyone,¡± she commanded. 
¡¡¡¡¡°Your Grace may trust in my discretion. Any man who rides with a sellsword company learns to hold his tongue, else he does not keep it long.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°In my company as well.¡± The queen put the coin away. She would think about it later. ¡°What of the other matter?¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Ser Gregor.¡± Qyburn shrugged. ¡°I have examined him, as you commanded. The poison on the Viper¡¯s spear was manticore venom from the east, I would stake my life on that.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Pycelle says no. He told my lord father that manticore venom kills the instant it reaches the heart.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°And so it does. But this venom has been thickened somehow, so as to draw out the Mountain¡¯s dying.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Thickened? Thickened how? With some other substance?¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°It may be as Your Grace suggests, though in most cases adulterating a poison only lessens its potency. It may be that the cause is . . . less natural, let us say. A spell, I think.¡± Is this one as big a fool as Pycelle? ¡°So are you telling me that the Mountain is dying of some black sorcery?¡± 
¡¡¡¡Qyburn ignored the mockery in her voice. ¡°He is dying of the venom, but slowly, and in exquisite agony. My efforts to ease his pain have proved as fruitless as Pycelle¡¯s. Ser Gregor is overly accustomed to the poppy, I fear. His squire tells me that he is plagued by blinding headaches and oft quaffs the milk of the poppy as lesser men quaff ale. Be that as it may, his veins have turned black from head to heel, his water is clouded with pus, and the venom has eaten a hole in his side as large as my fist. It is a wonder that the man is still alive, if truth be told.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°His size,¡± the queen suggested, frowning. ¡°Gregor is a very large man. Also a very stupid one. Too stupid to know when he should die, it seems.¡± She held out her cup, and Senelle filled it once again. ¡°His screaming frightens Tommen. It has even been known to wake me of a night. I would say it is past time we summoned Ilyn Payne.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Your Grace,¡± said Qyburn, ¡°mayhaps I might move Ser Gregor to the dungeons? His screams will not disturb you there, and I will be able to tend to him more freely.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Tend to him?¡± She laughed. ¡°Let Ser Ilyn tend to him.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°If that is Your Grace¡¯s wish,¡± Qyburn said, ¡°but this poison . . . it would be useful to know more about it, would it not? Send a knight to slay a knight and an archer to kill an archer, the smallfolk often say. To combat the black arts . . .¡± He did not finish the thought, but only smiled at her. 
¡¡¡¡He is not Pycelle, that much is plain. The queen weighed him, wondering. ¡°Why did the Citadel take your chain?¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°The archmaesters are all craven at heart. The grey sheep, Marwyn calls them. I was as skilled a healer as Ebrose, but aspired to surpass him. For hundreds of years the men of the Citadel have opened the bodies of the dead, to study the nature of life. I wished to understand the nature of death, so I opened the bodies of the living. For that crime the grey sheep shamed me and forced me into exile . . . but I understand the nature of life and death better than any man in Oldtown.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Do you?¡± That intrigued her. ¡°Very well. The Mountain is yours. Do what you will with him, but confine your studies to the black cells. When he dies, bring me his head. My father promised it to Dorne. Prince Doran would no doubt prefer to kill Gregor himself, but we all must suffer disappointments in this life.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Very good, Your Grace.¡± Qyburn cleared his throat. ¡°I am not so well provided as Pycelle, however. I must needs equip myself with certain . . .¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°I shall instruct Lord Gyles to provide you with gold sufficient for your needs. Buy yourself some new robes as well. You look as though you¡¯ve wandered up from Flea Bottom.¡± She studied his eyes, wondering how far she dared trust this one. ¡°Need I say that it will go ill for you if any word of your . . . labors . . . should pass beyond these walls?¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°No, Your Grace.¡± Qyburn gave her a reassuring smile. ¡°Your secrets are safe with me.¡± 
¡¡¡¡When he was gone, Cersei poured herself a cup of strongwine and drank it by the window, watching the shadows lengthen across the yard and thinking about the coin. 
¡¡¡¡Gold from the Reach. Why would an undergaoler in King¡¯s Landing have gold from the Reach, unless he were paid to help bring about Father¡¯s death? 
¡¡¡¡Try as she might, she could not seem to bring Lord Tywin¡¯s face to mind without seeing that silly little half smile and remembering the foul smell coming off his corpse. She wondered whether Tyrion was somehow behind that as well. It is small and cruel, like him. Could Tyrion have made Pycelle his catspaw? He sent the old man to the black cells, and this Rugen had charge of those cells, she remembered. All the strings were tangled up together in ways she did not like. This High Septon is Tyrion¡¯s creature too, Cersei recalled suddenly, and Father¡¯s poor body was in his care from dark till dawn. 
¡¡¡¡Her uncle arrived promptly at sunset, wearing a quilted doublet of charcoal-colored wool as somber as his face. Like all the Lannisters, Ser Kevan was fair-skinned and blond, though at five-and-fifty he had lost most of his hair. No one would ever call him comely. Thick of waist, round of shoulder, with a square jutting chin that his close-cropped yellow beard did little to conceal, he reminded her of some old mastiff . . . but a faithful old mastiff was the very thing that she required. 
¡¡¡¡They ate a simple supper of beets and bread and bloody beef with a flagon of Dornish red to wash it all down. Ser Kevan said little and scarce touched his wine cup. He broods too much, she decided. He needs to be put to work to get beyond his grief. 
¡¡¡¡She said as much, when the last of the food had been cleared away and the servants had departed. ¡°I know how much my father relied on you, Uncle. Now I must do the same.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°You need a Hand,¡± he said, ¡°and Jaime has refused you.¡± 
¡¡¡¡He is blunt. Very well. ¡°Jaime . . . I felt so lost with Father dead, I scarce knew what I was saying. Jaime is gallant, but a bit of a fool, let us be frank. Tommen needs a more seasoned man. Someone older . . .¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Mace Tyrell is older.¡± 
¡¡¡¡Her nostrils flared. ¡°Never.¡± Cersei pushed a lock of hair off her brow. ¡°The Tyrells overreach themselves.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°You would be a fool to make Mace Tyrell your Hand,¡± Ser Kevan admitted, ¡°but a bigger fool to make him your foe. I¡¯ve heard what happened in the Hall of Lamps. Mace should have known better than to broach such matters in public, but even so, you were unwise to shame him in front of half the court.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Better that than suffer another Tyrell on the council.¡± His reproach annoyed her. ¡°Rosby will make an adequate master of coin. You¡¯ve seen that litter of his, with its carvings and silk draperies. His horses are better dressed than most knights. A man that rich should have no problem finding gold. As for Handship . . . who better to finish my father¡¯s work than the brother who shared all his counsels?¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Every man needs someone he can trust. Tywin had me, and once your mother.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°He loved her very much.¡± Cersei refused to think about the dead whore in his bed. ¡°I know they are together now.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°So I pray.¡± Ser Kevan studied her face for a long moment before he replied. ¡°You ask much of me, Cersei.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°No more than my father did.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°I am tired.¡± Her uncle reached for his wine cup and took a swallow. ¡°I have a wife I have not seen in two years, a dead son to mourn, another son about to marry and assume a lordship. Castle Darry must be made strong again, its lands protected, its burned fields plowed and planted anew. Lancel needs my help.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°As does Tommen.¡± Cersei had not expected Kevan to require coaxing. He never played coy with Father. ¡°The realm needs you.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°The realm. Aye. And House Lannister.¡± He sipped his wine again. ¡°Very well. I will remain and serve His Grace . . .¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Very good,¡± she started to say, but Ser Kevan raised his voice and bulled right over her. 
¡¡¡¡¡°. . . so long as you name me regent as well as Hand and take yourself back to Casterly Rock.¡± 
¡¡¡¡For half a heartbeat Cersei could only stare at him. ¡°I am the regent,¡± she reminded him. 
¡¡¡¡¡°You were. Tywin did not intend that you continue in that role. He told me of his plans to send you back to the Rock and find a new husband for you.¡± 
¡¡¡¡Cersei could feel her anger rising. ¡°He spoke of such, yes. And I told him it was not my wish to wed again.¡± 
¡¡¡¡Her uncle was unmoved. ¡°If you are resolved against another marriage, I will not force it on you. As to the other, though . . . you are the Lady of Casterly Rock now. Your place is there.¡± How dare you? she wanted to scream. Instead, she said, ¡°I am also the Queen Regent. My place is with my son.¡± ¡°Your father thought not.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°My father is dead.¡± ¡°To my grief, and the woe of all the realm. Open your eyes and look about you, Cersei. The kingdom is in ruins. Tywin might have been able to set matters aright, but . . .¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°I shall set matters aright!¡± Cersei softened her tone. ¡°With your help, Uncle. If you will serve me as faithfully as you served my father¡ª¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°You are not your father. And Tywin always regarded Jaime as his rightful heir.¡± ¡°Jaime . . . Jaime has taken vows. Jaime never thinks, he laughs at everything and everyone and says whatever comes into his head. Jaime is a handsome fool.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°And yet he was your first choice to be the King¡¯s Hand. What does that make you, Cersei?¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°I told you, I was sick with grief, I did not think¡ª¡± ¡°No,¡± Ser Kevan agreed. ¡°Which is why you should return to Casterly Rock and leave the king with those who do.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°The king is my son!¡± Cersei rose to her feet. 
¡¡¡¡¡°Aye,¡± her uncle said, ¡°and from what I saw of Joffrey, you are as unfit a mother as you are a ruler.¡± She threw the contents of her wine cup full in his face. Ser Kevan rose with a ponderous dignity. ¡°Your Grace.¡± Wine trickled down his cheeks 
¡¡¡¡and dripped from his close-cropped beard. ¡°With your leave, might I withdraw?¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°By what right do you presume to give me terms? You are no more than one of my father¡¯s household knights.¡± ¡°I hold no lands, that is true. But I have certain incomes, and chests of coin set aside. My 
¡¡¡¡own father forgot none of his children when he died, and Tywin knew how to reward good service. I feed two hundred knights and can double that number if need be. There are freeriders who will follow my banner, and I have the gold to hire sellswords. You would be wise not to take me lightly, Your Grace . . . and wiser still not to make of me a foe.¡± ¡°Are you threatening me?¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°I am counseling you. If you will not yield the regency to me, name me your castellan for Casterly Rock and make either Mathis Rowan or Randyll Tarly the Hand of the King.¡± 
¡¡¡¡Tyrell bannermen, both of them. The suggestion left her speechless. Is he bought? she wondered. Has he taken Tyrell gold to betray House Lannister? 
¡¡¡¡¡°Mathis Rowan is sensible, prudent, well liked,¡± her uncle went on, oblivious. ¡°Randyll Tarly is the finest soldier in the realm. A poor Hand for peacetime, but with Tywin dead there¡¯s no better man to finish this war. Lord Tyrell cannot take offense if you choose one of his own bannermen as Hand. Both Tarly and Rowan are able men . . . and loyal. Name either one, and you make him yours. You strengthen yourself and weaken Highgarden, yet Mace will likely thank you for it.¡± He gave a shrug. ¡°That is my counsel, take it or no. You may make Moon Boy your Hand for all I care. My brother is dead, woman. I am going to take him home.¡± 
¡¡¡¡Traitor, she thought. Turncloak. She wondered how much Mace Tyrell had given him. ¡°You would abandon your king when he needs you most,¡± she told him. ¡°You would abandon Tommen.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Tommen has his mother.¡± Ser Kevan¡¯s green eyes met her own, unblinking. A last drop of wine trembled wet and red beneath his chin, and finally fell. ¡°Aye,¡± he added softly, after a pause, ¡°and his father too, I think.¡± 
¡¡¡¡JAIME 
¡¡¡¡Ser Jaime Lannister, all in white, stood beside his father¡¯s bier, five fingers curled about the hilt of a golden greatsword. 
¡¡¡¡At dusk, the interior of the Great Sept of Baelor turned dim and eerie. The last light of day slanted down through the high windows, washing the towering likenesses of the Seven in a red gloom. Around their altars, scented candles flickered whilst deep shadows gathered in the transepts and crept silently across the marble floors. The echoes of the evensongs died away as the last mourners were departing. 
¡¡¡¡Balon Swann and Loras Tyrell remained when the rest had gone. ¡°No man can stand a vigil for seven days and seven nights,¡± Ser Balon said. ¡°When did you last sleep, my lord?¡± ¡°When my lord father was alive,¡± said Jaime. 
¡¡¡¡¡°Allow me to stand tonight in your stead,¡± Ser Loras offered. 
¡¡¡¡¡°He was not your father.¡± You did not kill him. I did. Tyrion may have loosed the crossbow bolt that slew him, but I loosed Tyrion. ¡°Leave me.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°As my lord commands,¡± said Swann. Ser Loras looked as if he might have argued further, but Ser Balon took his arm and drew him off. Jaime listened to the echoes of their footfalls die away. And then he was alone again with his lord father, amongst the candles and the crystals and the sickly sweet smell of death. His back ached from the weight of his armor, and his legs felt almost numb. He shifted his stance a bit and tightened his fingers around the golden greatsword. He could not wield a sword, but he could hold one. His missing hand was throbbing. That was almost funny. He had more feeling in the hand he¡¯d lost than in the rest of the body that remained to him. 
¡¡¡¡My hand is hungry for a sword. I need to kill someone. Varys, for a start, but first I¡¯d need to find the rock he¡¯s hiding under. ¡°I commanded the eunuch to take him to a ship, not to your bedchamber,¡± he told the corpse. ¡°The blood is on his hands as much as . . . as Tyrion¡¯s.¡± The blood is on his hands as much as mine, he meant to say, but the words stuck in his throat. Whatever Varys did, I made him do. 
¡¡¡¡He had waited in the eunuch¡¯s chambers that night, when at last he had decided not to let his little brother die. As he waited, he had sharpened his dagger with one hand, taking a queer comfort from the scrape-scrape-scrape of steel on stone. At the sound of footsteps he stood beside the door. Varys entered in a wash of powder and lavender. Jaime stepped out behind him, kicked him in the back of the knee, knelt on his chest, and shoved the knife up under his soft white chin, forcing his head up. ¡°Why, Lord Varys,¡± he¡¯d said pleasantly, ¡°fancy meeting you here.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Ser Jaime?¡± Varys panted. ¡°You frightened me.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°I meant to.¡± When he twisted the dagger, a trickle of blood ran down the blade. ¡°I was thinking you might help me pluck my brother from his cell before Ser Ilyn lops his head off. It is an ugly head, I grant you, but he only has the one.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Yes . . . well . . . if you would . . . remove the blade . . . yes, gently, as it please my lord, gently, oh, I¡¯m pricked . . .¡± The eunuch touched his neck and gaped at the blood on his fingers. ¡°I have always abhorred the sight of my own blood.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°You¡¯ll have more to abhor shortly, unless you help me.¡± 
¡¡¡¡Varys struggled to a sitting position. ¡°Your brother . . . if the Imp should vanish unaccountably from his cell, q-questions would be asked. I would f-fear for my life . . .¡± ¡°Your life is mine. I do not care what secrets you know. If Tyrion dies, you will not long outlive him, I promise you.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Ah.¡± The eunuch sucked the blood off his fingers. ¡°You ask a dreadful thing . . . to loose the Imp who slew our lovely king. Or is it that you believe him innocent?¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Innocent or guilty,¡± Jaime had said, like the fool he was, ¡°a Lannister pays his debts.¡± The words had come so easy. 
¡¡¡¡He had not slept since. He could see his brother now, the way the dwarf had grinned beneath the stub of his nose as the torchlight licked his face. ¡°You poor stupid blind crippled fool,¡± he¡¯d snarled, in a voice thick with malice. ¡°Cersei is a lying whore, she¡¯s been fucking Lancel and Osmund Kettleblack and probably Moon Boy for all I know. And I am the monster they all say I am. Yes, I killed your vile son.¡± 
¡¡¡¡He never said he meant to kill our father. If he had, I would have stopped him. Then I would be the kinslayer, not him. 
¡¡¡¡Jaime wondered where Varys was hiding. Wisely, the master of whisperers had not returned to his own chambers, nor had a search of the Red Keep turned him up. It might be that the eunuch had taken ship with Tyrion, rather than remain to answer awkward questions. If so, the two of them were well out to sea by now, sharing a flagon of Arbor gold in the cabin of a galley. 
¡¡¡¡Unless my brother murdered Varys too, and left his corpse to rot beneath the castle. 
¡¡¡¡Down there, it might be years before his bones were found. Jaime had led a dozen guards below, with torches and ropes and lanterns. For hours they had groped through twisting passages, narrow crawl spaces, hidden doors, secret steps, and shafts that plunged down into utter blackness. Seldom had he felt so utterly a cripple. A man takes much for granted when he has two hands. Ladders, for an instance. Even crawling did not come easy; not for nought do they speak of hands and knees. Nor could he hold a torch and climb, as others could. 
¡¡¡¡And all for naught. They found only darkness, dust, and rats. And dragons, lurking down below. He remembered the sullen orange glow of the coals in the iron dragon¡¯s mouth. The brazier warmed a chamber at the bottom of a shaft where half a dozen tunnels met. On the floor he¡¯d found a scuffed mosaic of the three-headed dragon of House Targaryen done in tiles of black and red. I know you, Kingslayer, the beast seemed to be saying. I have been here all the time, waiting for you to come to me. And it seemed to Jaime that he knew that voice, the iron tones that had once belonged to Rhaegar, Prince of Dragonstone. 
¡¡¡¡The day had been windy when he said farewell to Rhaegar, in the yard of the Red Keep. The prince had donned his night-black armor, with the three-headed dragon picked out in rubies on his breastplate. ¡°Your Grace,¡± Jaime had pleaded, ¡°let Darry stay to guard the king this once, or Ser Barristan. Their cloaks are as white as mine.¡± Prince Rhaegar shook his head. ¡°My royal sire fears your father more than he does our cousin Robert. He wants you close, so Lord Tywin cannot harm him. I dare not take that crutch away from him at such an hour.¡± 
¡¡¡¡Jaime¡¯s anger had risen up in his throat. ¡°I am not a crutch. I am a knight of the Kingsguard.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Then guard the king,¡± Ser Jon Darry snapped at him. ¡°When you donned that cloak, you promised to obey.¡± 
¡¡¡¡Rhaegar had put his hand on Jaime¡¯s shoulder. ¡°When this battle¡¯s done I mean to call a council. Changes will be made. I meant to do it long ago, but . . . well, it does no good to speak of roads not taken. We shall talk when I return.¡± 
¡¡¡¡Those were the last words Rhaegar Targaryen ever spoke to him. Outside the gates an army had assembled, whilst another descended on the Trident. So the Prince of Dragonstone mounted up and donned his tall black helm, and rode forth to his doom. 
¡¡¡¡He was more right than he knew. When the battle was done, there were changes made. 
¡¡¡¡¡°Aerys thought no harm could come to him if he kept me near,¡± he told his father¡¯s corpse. ¡°Isn¡¯t that amusing?¡± Lord Tywin seemed to think so; his smile was wider than before. He seems to enjoy being dead. 
¡¡¡¡It was queer, but he felt no grief. Where are my tears? Where is my rage? Jaime Lannister had never lacked for rage. ¡°Father,¡± he told the corpse, ¡°it was you who told me that tears were a mark of weakness in a man, so you cannot expect that I should cry for you.¡± 
¡¡¡¡A thousand lords and ladies had come that morning to file past the bier, and several thousand smallfolk after noon. They wore somber clothes and solemn faces, but Jaime suspected that many and more were secretly delighted to see the great man brought low. Even in the west, Lord Tywin had been more respected than beloved, and King¡¯s Landing still remembered the Sack. 
¡¡¡¡Of all the mourners, Grand Maester Pycelle had seemed the most distraught. ¡°I have served six kings,¡± he told Jaime after the second service, whilst sniffing doubtfully about the corpse, ¡°but here before us lies the greatest man I ever knew. Lord Tywin wore no crown, yet he was all a king should be.¡± 
¡¡¡¡Without his beard, Pycelle looked not only old, but feeble. Shaving him was the cruelest thing Tyrion could have done, thought Jaime, who knew what it was to lose a part of yourself, the part that made you who you were. Pycelle¡¯s beard had been magnificent, white as snow and soft as lambswool, a luxuriant growth that covered cheeks and chin and flowed down almost to his belt. The Grand Maester had been wont to stroke it when he pontificated. It had given him an air of wisdom, and concealed all manner of unsavory things: the loose skin dangling beneath the old man¡¯s jaw, the small querulous mouth and missing teeth, warts and wrinkles and age spots too numerous to count. Though Pycelle was trying to regrow what he had lost, he was failing. Only wisps and tufts sprouted from his wrinkled cheeks and weak chin, so thin that Jaime could see the splotchy pink skin beneath. 
¡¡¡¡¡°Ser Jaime, I have seen terrible things in my time,¡± the old man said. ¡°Wars, battles, murders most foul . . . I was a boy in Oldtown when the grey plague took half the city and three-quarters of the Citadel. Lord Hightower burned every ship in port, closed the gates, and commanded his guards to slay all those who tried to flee, be they men, women, or babes in arms. They killed him when the plague had run its course. On the very day he reopened the port, they dragged him from his horse and slit his throat, and his young son¡¯s as well. To this day the ignorant in Oldtown will spit at the sound of his name, but Quenton Hightower did what was needed. Your father was that sort of man as well. A man who did what was needed.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Is that why he looks so pleased with himself?¡± 
¡¡¡¡The vapors rising from the corpse were making Pycelle¡¯s eyes water. ¡°The flesh . . . as the flesh dries, the muscles grow taut and pull his lips upward. That is no smile, only a . . . a drying, that is all.¡± He blinked back tears. ¡°You must excuse me. I am so very tired.¡± Leaning heavily on his cane, Pycelle tottered slowly from the sept. That one is dying too, Jaime realized. Small wonder Cersei called him useless. 
¡¡¡¡To be sure, his sweet sister seemed to think half the court was either useless or treasonous; Pycelle, the Kingsguard, the Tyrells, Jaime himself . . . even Ser Ilyn Payne, the silent knight who served as headsman. As King¡¯s Justice, the dungeons were his responsibility. Since he lacked a tongue, Payne had largely left the running of those dungeons to his underlings, but Cersei held him to blame for Tyrion¡¯s escape all the same. It was my work, not his, Jaime almost told her. Instead he had promised to find what answers he could from the chief undergaoler, a bentback old man named Rennifer Longwaters. 
¡¡¡¡¡°I see you wonder, what sort of name is that?¡± the man had cackled when Jaime went to question him. ¡°It is an old name, ¡¯tis true. I am not one to boast, but there is royal blood in my veins. I am descended from a princess. My father told me the tale when I was a tad of a lad.¡± Longwaters had not been a tad of a lad for many a year, to judge from his spotted head and the white hairs growing from his chin. ¡°She was the fairest treasure of the Maidenvault. Lord Oakenfist the great admiral lost his heart to her, though he was married to another. She gave their son the bastard name of ¡®Waters¡¯ in honor of his father, and he grew to be a great knight, as did his own son, who put the ¡®Long¡¯ before the ¡®Waters¡¯ so men might know that he was not basely born himself. So I have a little dragon in me.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Yes, I almost mistook you for Aegon the Conqueror,¡± Jaime had answered. ¡°Waters¡± was a common bastard name about Blackwater Bay; old Longwaters was more like to be descended from some minor household knight than from a princess. ¡°As it matters, though, I have more pressing concerns than your lineage.¡± 
¡¡¡¡Longwaters inclined his head. ¡°The lost prisoner.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°And the missing gaoler.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Rugen,¡± the old man supplied. ¡°An undergaoler. He had charge of the third level, the black cells.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Tell me of him,¡± Jaime had to say. A bloody farce. He knew who Rugen was, even if Longwaters did not. 
¡¡¡¡¡°Unkempt, unshaven, coarse of speech. I misliked the man, ¡¯tis true, I do confess it. Rugen was here when I first came, twelve years past. He held his appointment from King Aerys. The man was seldom here, it must be said. I made note of it in my reports, my lord. I most suredly did, I give you my word upon it, the word of a man with royal blood.¡± 
¡¡¡¡Mention that royal blood once more and I may spill some of it, thought Jaime. ¡°Who saw these reports?¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Certain of them went to the master of coin, others to the master of whisperers. All to the chief gaoler and the King¡¯s Justice. It has always been so in the dungeons.¡± Longwaters scratched his nose. ¡°Rugen was here when need be, my lord. That must be said. The black cells are little used. Before your lordship¡¯s little brother was sent down, we had Grand Maester Pycelle for a time, and before him Lord Stark the traitor. There were three others, common men, but Lord Stark gave them to the Night¡¯s Watch. I did not think it good to free those three, but the papers were in proper order. I made note of that in a report as well, you may be certain of it.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Tell me of the two gaolers who went to sleep.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Gaolers?¡± Longwaters sniffed. ¡°Those were no gaolers. They were merely turnkeys. The crown pays wages for twenty turnkeys, my lord, a full score, but during my time we have never had more than twelve. We are supposed to have six undergaolers as well, two on each level, but there are only the three.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°You and two others?¡± 
¡¡¡¡Longwaters sniffed again. ¡°I am the chief undergaoler, my lord. I am above the undergaolers. I am charged with keeping the counts. If my lord would like to look over my books, he will see that all the figures are exact.¡± Longwaters had consulted the great leather-bound book spread out before him. ¡°At present, we have four prisoners on the first level and one on the second, in addition to your lordship¡¯s brother.¡± The old man frowned. ¡°Who is fled, to be sure. ¡¯Tis true. I will strike him out.¡± He took up a quill and began to sharpen it. 
¡¡¡¡Six prisoners, Jaime thought sourly, while we pay wages for twenty turnkeys, six undergaolers, a chief undergaoler, a gaoler, and a King¡¯s Justice. ¡°I want to question these two turnkeys.¡± 
¡¡¡¡Rennifer Longwaters let up sharpening his quill and peered doubtfully up at Jaime. ¡°Question them, my lord?¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°You heard me.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°I did, my lord, I suredly did, and yet . . . my lord may question who he pleases, ¡¯tis true, it is not my place to say that he may not. But, ser, if I may be so bold, I do not think them like to answer. They are dead, my lord.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Dead? By whose command?¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Your own, I thought, or . . . the king¡¯s, mayhaps? I did not ask. It . . . it is not my place to question the Kingsguard.¡± 
¡¡¡¡That was salt for his wound; Cersei had used his own men to do her bloody work, them and her precious Kettleblacks. 
¡¡¡¡¡°You witless fools,¡± Jaime had snarled at Boros Blount and Osmund Kettleblack later, in a dungeon that stank of blood and death. ¡°What did you imagine you were doing?¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°No more¡¯n we was told, my lord.¡± Ser Boros was shorter than Jaime, but heavier. ¡°Her Grace commanded it. Your sister.¡± 
¡¡¡¡Ser Osmund hooked a thumb through his swordbelt. ¡°She said they were to sleep forever. So my brothers and me, we saw to it.¡± 
¡¡¡¡That you did. One corpse sprawled facedown upon the table, like a man passed out at a feast, but it was a puddle of blood beneath his head, not a puddle of wine. The second turnkey had managed to push back from the bench and draw his dagger before someone shoved a longsword through his ribs. His had been the longer, messier end. I told Varys no one was to be harmed in this escape, Jaime thought, but I should have told my brother and my sister. ¡°This was ill done, ser.¡± 
¡¡¡¡Ser Osmund shrugged. ¡°They won¡¯t be missed. I¡¯ll wager they was part of it, along with the one who¡¯s gone missing.¡± 
¡¡¡¡No, Jaime could have told him. Varys dosed their wine to make them sleep. ¡°If so, we might have coaxed the truth from them.¡± . . . she¡¯s been fucking Lancel and Osmund Kettleblack and Moon Boy for all I know . . . ¡°If I had a suspicious nature I might wonder why you were in such haste to make certain these two were never put to the question. Did you need to silence them to conceal your own part in this?¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Us?¡± Kettleblack choked on that. ¡°All we done was what the queen commanded. On my word as your Sworn Brother.¡± 
¡¡¡¡Jaime¡¯s phantom fingers twitched as he said, ¡°Get Osney and Osfryd down here and clean up this mess you¡¯ve made. And the next time my sweet sister commands you to kill a man, come to me first. Elsewise, stay out of my sight, ser.¡± 
¡¡¡¡The words echoed in his head in the dimness of Baelor¡¯s Sept. Above him, all the windows had gone black, and he could see the faint light of distant stars. The sun had set for good and all. The stench of death was growing stronger, despite the scented candles. The smell reminded Jaime Lannister of the pass below the Golden Tooth, where he had won a glorious victory in the first days of the war. On the morning after the battle, the crows had feasted on victors and vanquished alike, as once they had feasted on Rhaegar Targaryen after the Trident. How much can a crown be worth, when a crow can dine upon a king? 
¡¡¡¡There were crows circling the seven towers and great dome of Baelor¡¯s Sept even now, Jaime suspected, their black wings beating against the night air as they searched for a way inside. Every crow in the Seven Kingdoms should pay homage to you, Father. From Castamere to the Blackwater, you fed them well. That notion pleased Lord Tywin; his smile widened further. Bloody hell, he¡¯s grinning like a bridegroom at his bedding. 
¡¡¡¡That was so grotesque it made Jaime laugh aloud. 
¡¡¡¡The sound echoed through the transepts and crypts and chapels, as if the dead interred within the walls were laughing too. Why not? This is more absurd than a mummer¡¯s farce, me standing vigil for a father I helped to slay, sending men forth to capture the brother I helped to free . . . He had commanded Ser Addam Marbrand to search the Street of Silk. ¡°Look under every bed, you know how fond my brother is of brothels.¡± The gold cloaks would find more of interest beneath the whores¡¯ skirts than beneath their beds. He wondered how many bastard children would be born of the pointless search. 
¡¡¡¡Unbidden, his thoughts went to Brienne of Tarth. Stupid stubborn ugly wench. He wondered where she was. Father, give her strength. Almost a prayer . . . but was it the god he was invoking, the Father Above whose towering gilded likeness glimmered in the candlelight across the sept? Or was he praying to the corpse that lay before him? Does it matter? They never listened, either one. The Warrior had been Jaime¡¯s god since he was old enough to hold a sword. Other men might be fathers, sons, husbands, but never Jaime Lannister, whose sword was as golden as his hair. He was a warrior, and that was all he would ever be. 
¡¡¡¡I should tell Cersei the truth, admit that it was me who freed our little brother from his cell. The truth had worked so splendidly with Tyrion, after all. I killed your vile son, and now I¡¯m off to kill your father too. Jaime could hear the Imp laughing in the gloom. He turned his head to look, but the sound was only his own laughter coming back at him. He closed his eyes, and just as quickly snapped them open. I must not sleep. If he slept, he might dream. Oh, how Tyrion was sniggering. . . . a lying whore . . . fucking Lancel and Osmund Kettleblack . . . 
¡¡¡¡At midnight the hinges on the Father¡¯s Doors gave a groan as several hundred septons filed in for their devotions. Some were clad in the cloth-of-silver vestments and crystal coronals that marked the Most Devout; their humbler brethren wore their crystals on thongs about their necks and cinched white robes with seven-stranded belts, each plait a different color. Through the Mother¡¯s Doors marched white septas from their cloister, seven abreast and singing softly, while the silent sisters came single file down the Stranger¡¯s Steps. Death¡¯s handmaidens were garbed in soft grey, their faces hooded and shawled so only their eyes could be seen. A host of brothers appeared as well, in robes of brown and butternut and dun and even undyed roughspun, belted with lengths of hempen rope. Some hung the iron hammer of the Smith about their necks, whilst others carried begging bowls. 
¡¡¡¡None of the devout paid Jaime any mind. They made a circuit of the sept, worshiping at each of the seven altars to honor the seven aspects of the deity. To each god they made sacrifice, to each they sang a hymn. Sweet and solemn rose their voices. Jaime closed his eyes to listen, but opened them again when he began to sway. I am more weary than I knew. 
¡¡¡¡It had been years since his last vigil. And I was younger then, a boy of fifteen years. He had worn no armor then, only a plain white tunic. The sept where he¡¯d spent the night was not a third as large as any of the Great Sept¡¯s seven transepts. Jaime had laid his sword across the Warrior¡¯s knees, piled his armor at his feet, and knelt upon the rough stone floor before the altar. When dawn came his knees were raw and bloody. ¡°All knights must bleed, Jaime,¡± Ser Arthur Dayne had said, when he saw. ¡°Blood is the seal of our devotion.¡± With dawn he tapped him on the shoulder; the pale blade was so sharp that even that light touch cut through Jaime¡¯s tunic, so he bled anew. He never felt it. A boy knelt; a knight rose. The Young Lion, not the Kingslayer. 
¡¡¡¡But that was long ago, and the boy was dead. 
¡¡¡¡He could not have said when the devotions ended. Perhaps he slept, still standing. When the devout had filed out, the Great Sept grew still once more. The candles were a wall of stars burning in the darkness, though the air was rank with death. Jaime shifted his grip upon the golden greatsword. Perhaps he should have let Ser Loras relieve him after all. Cersei would have hated that. The Knight of Flowers was still half a boy, arrogant and vain, but he had it in him to be great, to perform deeds worthy of the White Book. 
¡¡¡¡The White Book would be waiting when this vigil was done, his page open in dumb reproach. I¡¯ll hack the bloody book to pieces before I¡¯ll fill it full of lies. Yet if he would not lie, what could he write but truth? A woman stood before him. 
¡¡¡¡It is raining again, he thought when he saw how wet she was. The water was trickling down her cloak to puddle round her feet. How did she get here? I never heard her enter. She was dressed like a tavern wench in a heavy roughspun cloak, badly dyed in mottled browns and fraying at the hem. A hood concealed her face, but he could see the candles dancing in the green pools of her eyes, and when she moved he knew her. 
¡¡¡¡¡°Cersei.¡± He spoke slowly, like a man waking from a dream, still wondering where he was. ¡°What hour is it?¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°The hour of the wolf.¡± His sister lowered her hood, and made a face. ¡°The drowned wolf, perhaps.¡± She smiled for him, so sweetly. ¡°Do you remember the first time I came to you like this? It was some dismal inn off Weasel Alley, and I put on servant¡¯s garb to get past Father¡¯s guards.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°I remember. It was Eel Alley.¡± She wants something of me. ¡°Why are you here, at this hour? What would you have of me?¡± His last word echoed up and down the sept, mememememememememememe, fading to a whisper. For a moment he dared to hope that all she wanted was the comfort of his arms. 
¡¡¡¡¡°Speak softly.¡± Her voice sounded strange . . . breathless, almost frightened. ¡°Jaime, Kevan has refused me. He will not serve as Hand, he . . . he knows about us. He said as much.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Refused?¡± That surprised him. ¡°How could he know? He will have read what Stannis wrote, but there is no . . .¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Tyrion knew,¡± she reminded him. ¡°Who can say what tales that vile dwarf may have told, or to whom? Uncle Kevan is the least of it. The High Septon . . . Tyrion raised him to the crown, when the fat one died. He may know as well.¡± She moved closer. ¡°You must be Tommen¡¯s Hand. I do not trust Mace Tyrell. What if he had a hand in Father¡¯s death? He may have been conspiring with Tyrion. The Imp could be on his way to Highgarden . . .¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°He¡¯s not.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Be my Hand,¡± she pleaded, ¡°and we¡¯ll rule the Seven Kingdoms together, like a king and his queen.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°You were Robert¡¯s queen. And yet you won¡¯t be mine.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°I would, if I dared. But our son¡ª¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Tommen is no son of mine, no more than Joffrey was.¡± His voice was hard. ¡°You made them Robert¡¯s too.¡± 
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡His sister flinched. ¡°You swore that you would always love me. It is not loving to make me beg.¡± 
¡¡¡¡Jaime could smell the fear on her, even through the rank stench of the corpse. He wanted to take her in his arms and kiss her, to bury his face in her golden curls and promise her that no one would ever hurt her . . . not here, he thought, not here in front of the gods, and Father. ¡°No,¡± he said. ¡°I cannot. Will not.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°I need you. I need my other half.¡± He could hear the rain pattering against the windows high above. ¡°You are me, I am you. I need you with me. In me. Please, Jaime. Please.¡± 
¡¡¡¡Jaime looked to make certain Lord Tywin was not rising from his bier in wrath, but his father lay still and cold, rotting. ¡°I was made for a battlefield, not a council chamber. And now it may be that I am unfit even for that.¡± 
¡¡¡¡Cersei wiped her tears away on a ragged brown sleeve. ¡°Very well. If it is battlefields you want, battlefields I shall give you.¡± She jerked her hood up angrily. ¡°I was a fool to come. I was a fool ever to love you.¡± Her footsteps echoed loudly in the quiet, and left damp splotches on the marble floor. 
¡¡¡¡Dawn caught Jaime almost unawares. As the glass in the dome began to lighten, suddenly there were rainbows shimmering off the walls and floors and pillars, bathing Lord Tywin¡¯s corpse in a haze of many-colored light. The King¡¯s Hand was rotting visibly. His face had taken on a greenish tinge, and his eyes were deeply sunken, two black pits. Fissures had opened in his cheeks, and a foul white fluid was seeping through the joints of his splendid gold-and-crimson armor to pool beneath his body. 
¡¡¡¡The septons were the first to see, when they returned for their dawn devotions. They sang their songs and prayed their prayers and wrinkled up their noses, and one of the Most Devout grew so faint he had to be helped from the sept. Shortly after, a flock of novices came swinging censers, and the air grew so thick with incense that the bier seemed cloaked in smoke. All the rainbows vanished in that perfumed mist, yet the stench persisted, a sweet rotten smell that made Jaime want to gag. 
¡¡¡¡When the doors were opened the Tyrells were amongst the first to enter, as befit their rank. Margaery had brought a great bouquet of golden roses. She placed them ostentatiously at the foot of Lord Tywin¡¯s bier but kept one back and held it beneath her nose as she took her seat. So the girl is as clever as she is pretty. Tommen could do a deal worse for a queen. Others have. Margaery¡¯s ladies followed her example. 
¡¡¡¡Cersei waited until the rest were in their places to make her entrance, with Tommen at her side. Ser Osmund Kettleblack paced beside them in his white enamel plate and white wool cloak. 
¡¡¡¡¡°. . . she¡¯s been fucking Lancel and Osmund Kettleblack and Moon Boy for all I know . . .¡± Jaime had seen Kettleblack naked in the bathhouse, had seen the black hair on his chest, and the coarser thatch between his legs. He pictured that chest pressed against his sister¡¯s, that hair scratching the soft skin of her breasts. She would not do that. The Imp lied. Spun gold and black wire tangled, sweaty. Kettleblack¡¯s narrow cheeks clenching each time he thrust. Jaime could hear his sister moan. No. A lie. 
¡¡¡¡Red-eyed and pale, Cersei climbed the steps to kneel above their father, drawing Tommen down beside her. The boy recoiled at the sight, but his mother seized his wrist before he could pull away. ¡°Pray,¡± she whispered, and Tommen tried. But he was only eight and Lord Tywin was a horror. One desperate breath of air, then the king began to sob. ¡°Stop that!¡± Cersei said. Tommen turned his head and doubled over, retching. His crown fell off and rolled across the marble floor. His mother pulled back in disgust, and all at once the king was running for the doors, as fast as his eight-year-old legs could carry him. 
¡¡¡¡¡°Ser Osmund, relieve me,¡± Jaime said sharply, as Kettleblack turned to chase the crown. He handed the man the golden sword and went after his king. In the Hall of Lamps he caught him, beneath the eyes of two dozen startled septas. ¡°I¡¯m sorry,¡± Tommen wept. ¡°I will do better on the morrow. Mother says a king must show the way, but the smell made me sick.¡± 
¡¡¡¡This will not do. Too many eager ears and watching eyes. ¡°Best we go outside, Your Grace.¡± Jaime led the boy out to where the air was as fresh and clean as King¡¯s Landing ever got. Twoscore gold cloaks had been posted around the plaza to guard the horses and the litters. He took the king off to the side, well away from everyone, and sat him down upon the marble steps. ¡°I wasn¡¯t scared,¡± the boy insisted. ¡°The smell made me sick. Didn¡¯t it make you sick? How could you bear it, Uncle, ser?¡± 
¡¡¡¡I have smelled my own hand rotting, when Vargo Hoat made me wear it for a pendant. ¡°A man can bear most anything, if he must,¡± Jaime told his son. I have smelled a man roasting, as King Aerys cooked him in his own armor. ¡°The world is full of horrors, Tommen. You can fight them, or laugh at them, or look without seeing . . . go away inside.¡± 
¡¡¡¡Tommen considered that. ¡°I . . . I used to go away inside sometimes,¡± he confessed, ¡°when Joffy . . .¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Joffrey.¡± Cersei stood over them, the wind whipping her skirts around her legs. ¡°Your brother¡¯s name was Joffrey. He would never have shamed me so.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°I never meant to. I wasn¡¯t frightened, Mother. It was only that your lord father smelled so bad . . .¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Do you think he smelled any sweeter to me? I have a nose too.¡± She caught his ear and pulled him to his feet. ¡°Lord Tyrell has a nose. Did you see him retching in the holy sept? Did you see Lady Margaery bawling like a baby?¡± Jaime got to his feet. ¡°Cersei, enough.¡± 
¡¡¡¡Her nostrils flared. ¡°Ser? Why are you here? You swore to stand vigil over Father until the wake was done, as I recall.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°It is done. Go look at him.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°No. Seven days and seven nights, you said. Surely the Lord Commander remembers how to count to seven. Take the number of your fingers, then add two.¡± 
¡¡¡¡Others had begun to stream out onto the plaza, fleeing the noxious odors in the sept. ¡°Cersei, keep your voice down,¡± Jaime warned. ¡°Lord Tyrell is approaching.¡± 
¡¡¡¡That reached her. The queen drew Tommen to her side. Mace Tyrell bowed before them. ¡°His Grace is not unwell, I hope?¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°The king was overwhelmed by grief,¡± said Cersei. 
¡¡¡¡¡°As are we all. If there is aught that I can do . . .¡± 
¡¡¡¡High above, a crow screamed loudly. He was perched on the statue of King Baelor, shitting on his holy head. ¡°There is much and more you can do for Tommen, my lord,¡± Jaime said. ¡°Perhaps you would do Her Grace the honor of supping with her, after the evening services?¡± 
¡¡¡¡Cersei threw him a withering look, but for once she had the sense to bite her tongue. 
¡¡¡¡¡°Sup?¡± Tyrell seemed taken aback. ¡°I suppose . . . of course, we should be honored. My lady wife and I.¡± 
¡¡¡¡The queen forced a smile and made pleasant noises. But when Tyrell had taken his leave and Tommen had been sent off with Ser Addam Marbrand, she turned on Jaime angrily. ¡°Are you drunk or dreaming, ser? Pray tell, why am I having supper with that grasping fool and his puerile wife?¡± A gust of wind stirred her golden hair. ¡°I will not name him Hand, if that¡¯s what¡ª¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°You need Tyrell,¡± Jaime broke in, ¡°but not here. Ask him to capture Storm¡¯s End for Tommen. Flatter him, and tell him you need him in the field, to replace Father. Mace fancies himself a mighty warrior. Either he will deliver Storm¡¯s End to you, or he will muck it up and look a fool. Either way, you win.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Storm¡¯s End?¡± Cersei looked thoughtful. ¡°Yes, but . . . Lord Tyrell has made it tediously plain that he will not leave King¡¯s Landing till Tommen marries Margaery.¡± Jaime sighed. ¡°Then let them wed. It will be years before Tommen is old enough to consummate the marriage. And until he does, the union can always be set aside. Give Tyrell his wedding and send him off to play at war.¡± 
¡¡¡¡A wary smile crept across his sister¡¯s face. ¡°Even sieges have their dangers,¡± she murmured. ¡°Why, our Lord of Highgarden might even lose his life in such a venture.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°There is that risk,¡± conceded Jaime. ¡°Especially if his patience runs thin this time, and he elects to storm the gate.¡± 
¡¡¡¡Cersei gave him a lingering look. ¡°You know,¡± she said, ¡°for a moment you sounded quite like Father.¡± 
¡¡¡¡BRIENNE 
¡¡¡¡The gates of Duskendale were closed and barred. Through the predawn gloom the town walls shimmered palely. On their ramparts, wisps of fog moved like ghostly sentinels. A dozen wayns and oxcarts had drawn up outside the gates, waiting for the sun to rise. Brienne took her place behind some turnips. Her calves ached, and it felt good to dismount and stretch her legs. Before long another wayn came rumbling from the woods. By the time the sky began to lighten, the queue stretched back a quarter mile. 
¡¡¡¡The farm folk gave her curious glances, but no one spoke to her. It is for me to talk to them, Brienne told herself, but she had always found it hard to speak with strangers. Even as a girl she had been shy. Long years of scorn had only made her shyer. I must ask after Sansa. How else will I find her? She cleared her throat. ¡°Goodwife,¡± she said to the woman on the turnip cart, ¡°perhaps you saw my sister on the road? A young maid, three-and-ten and fair of face, with blue eyes and auburn hair. She may be riding with a drunken knight.¡± 
¡¡¡¡The woman shook her head, but her husband said, ¡°Then she¡¯s no maid, I¡¯ll wager. Does the poor girl have a name?¡± 
¡¡¡¡Brienne¡¯s head was empty. I should have made up some name for her. Any name would do, but none came to her. 
¡¡¡¡¡°No name? Well, the roads are full of nameless girls.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°The lichyard¡¯s even fuller,¡± said his wife. 
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡As dawn broke, guardsmen appeared on the parapets. The farmers climbed onto their wagons and shook the reins. Brienne mounted as well and took a glance behind her. Most of the queue waiting to enter Duskendale were farm folk with loads of fruits and vegetables to sell. A pair of wealthy townsmen sat on well-bred palfreys a dozen places behind her, and farther back she spied a skinny boy on a piebald rounsey. There was no sign of the two knights, nor Ser Shadrich the Mad Mouse. 
¡¡¡¡The guards were waving through the wayns with scarce a look, but when Brienne reached the gate she gave them pause. ¡°Halt, you!¡± the captain cried. A pair of men in chainmail hauberks crossed their spears to bar her way. ¡°State your purpose here.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°I seek the Lord of Duskendale, or his maester.¡± 
¡¡¡¡The captain¡¯s eyes lingered on her shield. ¡°The black bat of Lothston. Those are arms of ill repute.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°They are not mine. I mean to have the shield repainted.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Aye?¡± The captain rubbed his stubbled chin. ¡°My sister does such work, as it happens. You¡¯ll find her at the house with the painted doors, across from the Seven Swords.¡± He gestured to the guards. ¡°Let her pass, lads. It¡¯s a wench.¡± 
¡¡¡¡The gatehouse opened on a market square, where those who had entered before her were unloading to hawk their turnips, yellow onions, and sacks of barleycorn. Others were selling arms and armor, and very cheaply to judge from the prices they shouted out as she rode by. The looters come with the carrion crows after every battle. Brienne walked her horse past mail shirts still caked with brown blood, dinted helms, notched longswords. There was clothing to be had as well: leather boots, fur cloaks, stained surcoats with suspicious rents. She knew many of the badges. The mailed fist, the moose, the white sun, the double-bladed axe, all those were northern sigils. Tarly men had perished here as well, though, and many from the stormlands. She saw red and green apples, a shield that bore the three thunderbolts of Leygood, horse trappings patterned with the ants of Ambrose. Lord Tarly¡¯s own striding huntsman appeared on many a badge and brooch and doublet. Friend or foe, the crows care not. 
¡¡¡¡There were pine and linden shields to be had for pennies, but Brienne rode past them. She meant to keep the heavy oaken shield Jaime had given her, the one he¡¯d borne himself from Harrenhal to King¡¯s Landing. A pine shield had its advantages. It was lighter, and therefore easier to bear, and the soft wood was more like to trap a foeman¡¯s axe or sword. But oak gave more protection, if you were strong enough to bear its weight. 
¡¡¡¡Duskendale was built around its harbor. North of town the chalk cliffs rose; to the south a rocky headland shielded the ships at anchor from storms coming up the narrow sea. The castle overlooked the port, its square keep and big drum towers visible from every part of town. In the crowded cobbled streets, it was easier to walk than ride, so Brienne put her mare up in a stable and continued on afoot, with her shield slung across her back and her bedroll tucked up beneath one arm. 
¡¡¡¡The captain¡¯s sister was not hard to find. The Seven Swords was the largest inn in town, a four-story structure that towered over its neighbors, and the double doors on the house across the way were painted gorgeously. They showed a castle in an autumn wood, the trees done up in shades of gold and russet. Ivy crawled up the trunks of ancient oaks, and even the acorns had been done with loving care. When Brienne peered more closely, she saw creatures in the foliage: a sly red fox, two sparrows on a branch, and behind those leaves the shadow of a boar. 
¡¡¡¡¡°Your door is very pretty,¡± she told the dark-haired woman who answered when she knocked. ¡°What castle is that meant to be?¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°All castles,¡± said the captain¡¯s sister. ¡°The only one I know is the Dun Fort by the harbor. I made t¡¯other in my head, what a castle ought to look like. I never seen a dragon neither, nor a griffin, nor a unicorn.¡± She had a cheerful manner, but when Brienne showed her the shield her face went dark. ¡°My old ma used to say that giant bats flew out from Harrenhal on moonless nights, to carry bad children to Mad Danelle for her cookpots. Sometimes I¡¯d hear them scrabbling at the shutters.¡± She sucked her teeth a moment, thoughtful. ¡°What goes in its place?¡± 
¡¡¡¡The arms of Tarth were quartered rose and azure, and bore a yellow sun and crescent moon. But so long as men believed her to be a murderess, Brienne dare not carry them. ¡°Your door reminded me of an old shield I once saw in my father¡¯s armory.¡± She described the arms as best she could recall them. 
¡¡¡¡The woman nodded. ¡°I can paint it straightaway, but the paint will need to dry. Take a room at the Seven Swords, if it please you. I¡¯ll bring the shield to you by morning.¡± 
¡¡¡¡Brienne had not meant to overnight in Duskendale, but it might be for the best. She did not know if the lord of the castle was in residence, or whether he would consent to see her. She thanked the painter and crossed the cobblestones to the inn. Above its door, seven wooden swords swung beneath an iron spike. The whitewash that covered them was cracked and peeling, but Brienne knew their meaning. They stood for the seven sons of Darklyn who had worn the white cloaks of the Kingsguard. No other house in all the realm could claim as many. They were the glory of their House. And now they are a sign above an inn. She pushed into the common room and asked the innkeep for a room and a bath. 
¡¡¡¡He put her on the second floor, and a woman with a liver-colored birthmark on her face brought up a wooden tub, and then the water, pail by pail. ¡°Do any Darklyns remain in Duskendale?¡± Brienne asked as she climbed into the tub. 
¡¡¡¡¡°Well, there¡¯s Darkes, I¡¯m one myself. My husband says I was Darke before we wed, and darker afterward.¡± She laead frighten you?¡± Ser Waymar Royce asked with just the hint of a smile.
   Gared did not rise to the bait. He was an old man, past fifty, and he had seen the lordlings come and go. ¡°Dead is dead,¡± he said. ¡°We have no business with the dead.¡±
   ¡°Are they dead?¡± Royce asked softly. ¡°What proof have we?¡±
   ¡°Will saw them,¡± Gared said. ¡°If he says they are dead, that¡¯s proof enough for me.¡±
   Will had known they would drag him into the quarrel sooner or later. He wished it had been later rather than sooner. ¡°My mother told me that dead men sing no songs,¡± he put in.
   ¡°My wet nurse said the same thing, Will,¡± Royce replied. ¡°Never believe anything you hear at a woman¡¯s tit. There are things to be learned even from the dead.¡± His voice echoed, too loud in the twilit forest.
   ¡°We have a long ride before us,¡± Gared pointed out. ¡°Eight days, maybe nine. And night is falling.¡±
   Ser Waymar Royce glanced at the sky with disinterest. ¡°It does that every day about this time. Are you unmanned by the dark, Gared?¡±
   Will could see the tightness around Gared¡¯s mouth, the barely suppressed anger in his eyes under the thick black hood of his cloak. Gared had spent forty years in the Night¡¯s Watch, man and boy, and he was not accustomed to being made light of. Yet it was more than that. Under the wounded pride, Will could sense something else in the older man. You could taste it; a nervous tension that came perilous close to fear.
   Will shared his unease. He had been four years on the Wall. The first time he had been sent beyond, all the old stories had come rushing back, and his bowels had turned to water. He had laughed about it afterward. He was a veteran of a hundred rangings by now, and the endless dark wilderness that the southron called the haunted forest had no more terrors for him.
   Until tonight. Something was different tonight. There was an edge to this darkness that made his hackles rise. Nine days they had been riding, north and northwest and then north again, farther and farther from the Wall, hard on the track of a band of wildling raiders. Each day had been worse than the day that had come before it. Today was the worst of all. A cold wind was blowing out of the north, and it made the trees rustle like living things. All day, Will had felt as though something were watching him, something cold and implacable that loved him not. Gared had felt it too. Will wanted nothing so much as to ride hellbent for the safety of the Wall, but that was not a feeling to share with your commander.
   Especially not a commander like this one.
   Ser Waymar Royce was the youngest son of an ancient house with too many heirs. He was a handsome youth of eighteen, grey-eyed and graceful and slender as a knife. Mounted on his huge black destrier, the knight towered above Will and Gared on their smaller garrons. He wore black leather boots, black woolen pants, black moleskin gloves, and a fine supple coat of gleaming black ringmail over layers of black wool and boiled leather. Ser Waymar had been a Sworn Brother of the Night¡¯s Watch for less than half a year, but no one could say he had not prepared for his vocation. At least insofar as his wardrobe was concerned.
   His cloak was his crowning glory; sable, thick and black and soft as sin. ¡°Bet he killed them all himself, he did,¡± Gared told the barracks over wine, ¡°twisted their little heads off, our mighty warrior.¡± They had all shared the laugh.
   It is hard to take orders from a man you laughed at in your cups, Will reflected as he sat shivering atop his garron. Gared must have felt the same.
   ¡°Mormont said as we should track them, and we did,¡± Gared said. ¡°They¡¯re dead. They shan¡¯t trouble us no more. There¡¯s hard riding before us. I don¡¯t like this weather. If it snows, we could be a fortnight getting back, and snow¡¯s the best we can hope for. Ever seen an ice storm, my lord?¡±
   The lordling seemed not to hear him. He studied the deepening twilight in that half-bored, half-distracted way he had. Will had ridden with the knight long enough to understand that it was best not to interrupt him when he looked like that. ¡°Tell me again what you saw, Will. All the details. Leave nothing out.¡±
   Will had been a hunter before he joined the Night¡¯s Watch. Well, a poacher in truth. Mallister freeriders had caught him red-handed in the Mallisters¡¯ own woods, skinning one of the Mallisters¡¯ own bucks, and it had been a choice of putting on the black or losing a hand. No one could move through the woods as silent as Will, and it had not taken the black brothers long to discover his talent.
   ¡°The camp is two miles farther on, over that ridge, hard beside a stream,¡± Will said. ¡°I got close as I dared. There¡¯s eight of them, men and women both. No children I could see. They put up a lean-to against the rock. The snow¡¯s pretty well covered it now, but I could still make it out. No fire burning, but the firepit was still plain as day. No one moving. I watched a long time. No living man ever lay so still.¡±
   ¡°Did you see any blood?¡±
   ¡°Well, no,¡± Will admitted.
   ¡°Did you see any weapons?¡±
   ¡°Some swords, a few bows. One man had an axe. Heavy-looking, double-bladed, a cruel piece of iron. It was on the ground beside him, right by his hand.¡±
   ¡°Did you make note of the position of the bodies?¡±
   Will shrugged. ¡°A couple are sitting up against the rock. Most of them on the ground. Fallen, like.¡±
   ¡°Or sleeping,¡± Royce suggested.
   ¡°Fallen,¡± Will insisted. ¡°There¡¯s one woman up an ironwood, half-hid in the branches. A far-eyes.¡± He smiled thinly. ¡°I took care she never saw me. When I got closer, I saw that she wasn¡¯t moving neither.¡± Despite himself, he shivered.
   ¡°You have a chill?¡± Royce asked.
   ¡°Some,¡± Will muttered. ¡°The wind, m¡¯lord.¡±
   The young knight turned back to his grizzled man-at-arms. Frostfallen leaves whispered past them, and Royce¡¯s destrier moved restlessly. ¡°What do you think might have killed these men, Gared?¡± Ser Waymar asked casually. He adjusted the drape of his long sable cloak.
   ¡°It was the cold,¡± Gared said with iron certainty. ¡°I saw men freeze last winter, and the one before, when I was half a boy. Everyone talks about snows forty foot deep, and how the ice wind comes howling out of the north, but the real enemy is the cold. It steals up on you quieter than Will, and at first you shiver and your teeth chatter and you stamp your feet and dream of mulled wine and nice hot fires. It burns, it does. Nothing burns like the cold. But only for a while. Then it gets inside you and starts to fill you up, and after a while you don¡¯t have the strength to fight it. It¡¯s easier just to sit down or go to sleep. They say you don¡¯t feel any pain toward the end. First you go weak and drowsy, and everything starts to fade, and then it¡¯s like sinking into a sea of warm milk. Peaceful, like.¡±
   ¡°Such eloquence, Gared,¡± Ser Waymar observed. ¡°I never suspected you had it in you.¡±
   ¡°I¡¯ve had the cold in me too, lordling.¡± Gared pulled back his hood, giving Ser Waymar a good long look at the stumps where his ears had been. ¡°Two ears, three toes, and the little finger off my left hand. I got off light. We found my brother frozen at his watch, with a smile on his face.¡±
   Ser Waymar shrugged. ¡°You ought dress more warmly, Gared.¡±
   Gared glared at the lordling, the scars around his ear holes flushed red with anger where Maester Aemon had cut the ears away. ¡°We¡¯ll see how warm you can dress when the winter comes.¡± He pulled up his hood and hunched over his garron, silent and sullen.
   ¡°If Gared said it was the cold?.?.?.?¡± Will began.
   ¡°Have you drawn any watches this past week, Will?¡±
   ¡°Yes, m¡¯lord.¡± There never was a week when he did not draw a dozen bloody watches. What was the man driving at?
   ¡°And how did you find the Wall?¡±
   ¡°Weeping,¡± Will said, frowning. He saw it clear enough, now that the lordling had pointed it out. ¡°They couldn¡¯t have froze. Not if the Wall was weeping. It wasn¡¯t cold enough.¡±
   Royce nodded. ¡°Bright lad. We¡¯ve had a few light frosts this past week, and a quick flurry of snow now and then, but surely no cold fierce enough to kill eight grown men. Men clad in fur and leather, let me remind you, with shelter near at hand, and the means of making fire.¡± The knight¡¯s smile was cocksure. ¡°Will, lead us there. I would see these dead men for myself.¡±
   And then there was nothing to be done for it. The order had been given, and honor bound them to obey.
   Will went in front, his shaggy little garron picking the way carefully through the undergrowth. A light snow had fallen the night before, and there were stones and roots and hidden sinks lying just under its crust, waiting for the careless and the unwary. Ser Waymar Royce came next, his great black destrier snorting impatiently. The warhorse was the wrong mount for ranging, but try and tell that to the lordling. Gared brought up the rear. The old man-at-arms muttered to himself as he rode.
   Twilight deepened. The cloudless sky turned a deep purple, the color of an old bruise, then faded to black. The stars began to come out. A half-moon rose. Will was grateful for the light.
   ¡°We can make a better pace than this, surely,¡± Royce said when the moon was full risen.
   ¡°Not with this horse,¡± Will said. Fear had made him insolent. ¡°Perhaps my lord would care to take the lead?¡±
   Ser Waymar Royce did not deign to reply.
   Somewhere off in the wood a wolf howled.
   Will pulled his garron over beneath an ancient gnarled ironwood and dismounted.
   ¡°Why are you stopping?¡± Ser Waymar asked.
   ¡°Best go the rest of the way on foot, m¡¯lord. It¡¯s just over that ridge.¡±
   Royce paused a moment, staring off into the distance, his face reflective. A cold wind whispered through the trees. His great sable cloak stirred behind like something half-alive.
   ¡°There¡¯s something wrong here,¡± Gared muttered.
   The young knight gave him a disdainful smile. ¡°Is there?¡±
   ¡°Can¡¯t you feel it?¡± Gared asked. ¡°Listen to the darkness.¡±
   Will could feel it. Four years in the Night¡¯s Watch, and he had never been so afraid. What was it?
   ¡°Wind. Trees rustling. A wolf. Which sound is it that unmans you so, Gared?¡± When Gared did not answer, Royce slid gracefully from his saddle. He tied the destrier securely to a low-hanging limb, well away from the other horses, and drew his longsword from its sheath. Jewels glittered in its hilt, and the moonlight ran down the shining steel. It was a splendid weapon, castle-forged, and new-made from the look of it. Will doubted it had ever been swung in anger.
   ¡°The trees press close here,¡± Will warned. ¡°That sword will tangle you up, m¡¯lord. Better a knife.¡±
   ¡°If I need instruction, I will ask for it,¡± the young lord said. ¡°Gared, stay here. Guard the horses.¡±
   Gared dismounted. ¡°We need a fire. I¡¯ll see to it.¡±
   ¡°How big a fool are you, old man? If there are enemies in this wood, a fire is the last thing we want.¡±
   ¡°There¡¯s some enemies a fire will keep away,¡± Gared said. ¡°Bears and direwolves and?.?.?.?and other things?.?.?.?¡±
   Ser Waymar¡¯s mouth became a hard line. ¡°No fire.¡±
   Gared¡¯s hood shadowed his face, but Will could see the hard glitter in his eyes as he stared at the knight. For a moment he was afraid the older man would go for his sword. It was a short, ugly thing, its grip discolored by sweat, its edge nicked from hard use, but Will would not have given an iron bob for the lordling¡¯s life if Gared pulled it from its scabbard.
   Finally Gared looked down. ¡°No fire,¡± he muttered, low under his breath.
   Royce took it for acquiescence and turned away. ¡°Lead on,¡± he said to Will.
   Will threaded their way through a thicket, then started up the slope to the low ridge where he had found his vantage point under a sentinel tree. Under the thin crust of snow, the ground was damp and muddy, slick footing, with rocks and hidden roots to trip you up. Will made no sound as he climbed. Behind him, he heard the soft metallic slither of the lordling¡¯s ringmail, the rustle of leaves, and muttered curses as reaching branches grabbed at his longsword and tugged on his splendid sable cloak.
   The great sentinel was right there at the top of the ridge, where Will had known it would be, its lowest branches a bare foot off the ground. Will slid in underneath, flat on his belly in the snow and the mud, and looked down on the empty clearing below.
   His heart stopped in his chest. For a moment he dared not breathe. Moonlight shone down on the clearing, the ashes of the firepit, the snow-covered lean-to, the great rock, the little half-frozen stream. Everything was just as it had been a few hours ago.
   They were gone. All the bodies were gone.
   ¡°Gods!¡± he heard behind him. A sword slashed at a branch as Ser Waymar Royce gained the ridge. He stood there beside the sentinel, longsword in hand, his cloak billowing behind him as the wind came up, outlined nobly against the stars for all to see.
   ¡°Get down!¡± Will whispered urgently. ¡°Something¡¯s wrong.¡±
   Royce did not move. He looked down at the empty clearing and laughed. ¡°Your dead men seem to have moved camp, Will.¡±
   Will¡¯s voice abandoned him. He groped for words that did not come. It was not possible. His eyes swept back and forth over the abandoned campsite, stopped on the axe. A huge double-bladed battle-axe, still lying where he had seen it last, untouched. A valuable weapon?.?.?.?
   ¡°On your feet, Will,¡± Ser Waymar commanded. ¡°There¡¯s no one here. I won¡¯t have you hiding under a bush.¡±
   Reluctantly, Will obeyed.
   Ser Waymar looked him over with open disapproval. ¡°I am not going back to Castle Black a failure on my first ranging. We will find these men.¡± He glanced around. ¡°Up the tree. Be quick about it. Look for a fire.¡±
   Will turned away, wordless. There was no use to argue. The wind was moving. It cut right through him. He went to the tree, a vaulting grey-green sentinel, and began to climb. Soon his hands were sticky with sap, and he was lost among the needles. Fear filled his gut like a meal he could not digest. He whispered a prayer to the nameless gods of the wood, and slipped his dirk free of its sheath. He put it between his teeth to keep both hands free for climbing. The taste of cold iron in his mouth gave him comfort.
   Down below, the lordling called out suddenly, ¡°Who goes there?¡± Will heard uncertainty in the challenge. He stopped climbing; he listened; he watched.
   The woods gave answer: the rustle of leaves, the icy rush of the stream, a distant hoot of a snow owl.
   The Others made no sound.
   Will saw movement from the corner of his eye. Pale shapes gliding through the wood. He turned his head, glimpsed a white shadow in the darkness. Then it was gone. Branches stirred gently in the wind, scratching at one another with wooden fingers. Will opened his mouth to call down a warning, and the words seemed to freeze in his throat. Perhaps he was wrong. Perhaps it had only been a bird, a reflection on the snow, some trick of the moonlight. What had he seen, after all?
   ¡°Will, where are you?¡± Ser Waymar called up. ¡°Can you see anything?¡± He was turning in a slow circle, suddenly wary, his sword in hand. He must have felt them, as Will felt them. There was nothing to see. ¡°Answer me! Why is it so cold?¡±
   It was cold. Shivering, Will clung more tightly to his perch. His face pressed hard against the trunk of the sentinel. He could feel the sweet, sticky sap on his cheek.
   A shadow emerged from the dark of the wood. It stood in front of Royce. Tall, it was, and gaunt and hard as old bones, with flesh pale as milk. Its armor seemed to change color as it moved; here it was white as new-fallen snow, there black as shadow, everywhere dappled with the deep grey-green of the trees. The patterns ran like moonlight on water with every step it took.
   Will heard the breath go out of Ser Waymar Royce in a long hiss. ¡°Come no farther,¡± the lordling warned. His voice cracked like a boy¡¯s. He threw the long sable cloak back over his shoulders, to free his arms for battle, and took his sword in both hands. The wind had stopped. It was very cold.
   The Other slid forward on silent feet. In its hand was a longsword like none that Will had ever seen. No human metal had gone into the forging of that blade. It was alive with moonlight, translucent, a shard of crystal so thin that it seemed almost to vanish when seen edge-on. There was a faint blue shimmer to the thing, a ghost-light that played around its edges, and somehow Will knew it was sharper than any razor.
   Ser Waymar met him bravely. ¡°Dance with me then.¡± He lifted his sword high over his head, defiant. His hands trembled from the weight of it, or perhaps from the cold. Yet in that moment, Will thought, he was a boy no longer, but a man of the Night¡¯s Watch.
   The Other halted. Will saw its eyes; blue, deeper and bluer than any human eyes, a blue that burned like ice. They fixed on the longsword trembling on high, watched the moonlight running cold along the metal. For a heartbeat he dared to hope.
   They emerged silently from the shadows, twins to the first. Three of them?.?.?.?four?.?.?.?five?.?.?.?Ser Waymar may have felt the cold that came with them, but he never saw them, never heard them. Will had to call out. It was his duty. And his death, if he did. He shivered, and hugged the tree, and kept the silence.
   The pale sword came shivering through the air.
   Ser Waymar met it with steel. When the blades met, there was no ring of metal on metal; only a high, thin sound at the edge of hearing, like an animal screaming in pain. Royce checked a second blow, and a third, then fell back a step. Another flurry of blows, and he fell back again.
   Behind him, to right, to left, all around him, the watchers stood patient, faceless, silent, the shifting patterns of their delicate armor making them all but invisible in the wood. Yet they made no move to interfere.
   Again and again the swords met, until Will wanted to cover his ears against the strange anguished keening of their clash. Ser Waymar was panting from the effort now, his breath steaming in the moonlight. His blade was white with frost; the Other¡¯s danced with pale blue light.
   Then Royce¡¯s parry came a beat too late. The pale sword bit through the ringmail beneath his arm. The young lord cried out in pain. Blood welled between the rings. It steamed in the cold, and the droplets seemed red as fire where they touched the snow. Ser Waymar¡¯s fingers brushed his side. His moleskin glove came away soaked with red.
   The Other said something in a language that Will did not know; his voice was like the cracking of ice on a winter lake, and the words were mocking.
   Ser Waymar Royce found his fury. ¡°For Robert!¡± he shouted, and he came up snarling, lifting the frost-covered longsword with both hands and swinging it around in a flat sidearm slash with all his weight behind it. The Other¡¯s parry was almost lazy.
   When the blades touched, the steel shattered.
   A scream echoed through the forest night, and the longsword shivered into a hundred brittle pieces, the shards scattering like a rain of needles. Royce went to his knees, shrieking, and covered his eyes. Blood welled between his fingers.
   The watchers moved forward together, as if some signal had been given. Swords rose and fell, all in a deathly silence. It was cold butchery. The pale blades sliced through ringmail as if it were silk. Will closed his eyes. Far beneath him, he heard their voices and laughter sharp as icicles.
   When he found the courage to look again, a long time had passed, and the ridge below was empty.
   He stayed in the tree, scarce daring to breathe, while the moon crept slowly across the black sky. Finally, his muscles cramping and his fingers numb with cold, he climbed down.
   Royce¡¯s body lay facedown in the snow, one arm outflung. The thick sable cloak had been slashed in a dozen places. Lying dead like that, you saw how young he was. A boy.
   He found what was left of the sword a few feet away, the end splintered and twisted like a tree struck by lightning. Will knelt, looked around warily, and snatched it up. The broken sword would be his proof. Gared would know what to make of it, and if not him, then surely that old bear Mormont or Maester Aemon. Would Gared still be waiting with the horses? He had to hurry.
   Will rose. Ser Waymar Royce stood over him.
   His fine clothes were a tatter, his face a ruin. A shard from his sword transfixed the blind white pupil of his left eye.
   The right eye was open. The pupil burned blue. It saw.
   The broken sword fell from nerveless fingers. Will closed his eyes to pray. Long, elegant hands brushed his cheek, then tightened around his throat. They were gloved in the finest moleskin and sticky with blood, yet the touch was icy cold.
   
   1£®BRAN
   The morning had dawned clear and cold, with a crispness that hinted at the end of summer. They set forth at daybreak to see a man beheaded, twenty in all, and Bran rode among them, nervous with excitement. This was the first time he had been deemed old enough to go with his lord father and his brothers to see the king¡¯s justice done. It was the ninth year of summer, and the seventh of Bran¡¯s life.
   The man had been taken outside a small holdfast in the hills. Robb thought he was a wildling, his sword sworn to Mance Rayder, the King-beyond-the-Wall. It made Bran¡¯s skin prickle to think of it. He remembered the hearth tales Old Nan told them. The wildlings were cruel men, she said, slavers and slayers and thieves. They consorted with giants and ghouls, stole girl children in the dead of night, and drank blood from polished horns. And their women lay with the Others in the Long Night to sire terrible half-human children.
   But the man they found bound hand and foot to the holdfast wall awaiting the king¡¯s justice was old and scrawny, not much taller than Robb. He had lost both ears and a finger to frostbite, and he dressed all in black, the same as a brother of the Night¡¯s Watch, except that his furs were ragged and greasy.
   The breath of man and horse mingled, steaming, in the cold morning air as his lord father had the man cut down from the wall and dragged before them. Robb and Jon sat tall and still on their horses, with Bran between them on his pony, trying to seem older than seven, trying to pretend that he¡¯d seen all this before. A faint wind blew through the holdfast gate. Over their heads flapped the banner of the Starks of Winterfell: a grey direwolf racing across an ice-white field.
   Bran¡¯s father sat solemnly on his horse, long brown hair stirring in the wind. His closely trimmed beard was shot with white, making him look older than his thirty-five years. He had a grim cast to his grey eyes this day, and he seemed not at all the man who would sit before the fire in the evening and talk softly of the age of heroes and the children of the forest. He had taken off Father¡¯s face, Bran thought, and donned the face of Lord Stark of Winterfell.
   There were questions asked and answers given there in the chill of morning, but afterward Bran could not recall much of what had been said. Finally his lord father gave a command, and two of his guardsmen dragged the ragged man to the ironwood stump in the center of the square. They forced his head down onto the hard black wood. Lord Eddard Stark dismounted and his ward Theon Greyjoy brought forth the sword. ¡°Ice,¡± that sword was called. It was as wide across as a man¡¯s hand, and taller even than Robb. The blade was Valyrian steel, spell-forged and dark as smoke. Nothing held an edge like Valyrian steel.
   His father peeled off his gloves and handed them to Jory Cassel, the captain of his household guard. He took hold of Ice with both hands and said, ¡°In the name of Robert of the House Baratheon, the First of his Name, King of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm, by the word of Eddard of the House Stark, Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North, I do sentence you to die.¡± He lifted the greatsword high above his head.
   Bran¡¯s bastard brother Jon Snow moved closer. ¡°Keep the pony well in hand,¡± he whispered. ¡°And don¡¯t look away. Father will know if you do.¡±
   Bran kept his pony well in hand, and did not look away.
   His father took off the man¡¯s head with a single sure stroke. Blood sprayed out across the snow, as red as surnmerwine. One of the horses reared and had to be restrained to keep from bolting. Bran could not take his eyes off the blood. The snows around the stump drank it eagerly, reddening as he watched.
   The head bounced off a thick root and rolled. It came up near Greyjoy¡¯s feet. Theon was a lean, dark youth of nineteen who found everything amusing. He laughed, put his boot on the head, and kicked it away.
   ¡°Ass,¡± Jon muttered, low enough so Greyjoy did not hear. He put a hand on Bran¡¯s shoulder, and Bran looked over at his bastard brother. ¡°You did well,¡± Jon told him solemnly. Jon was fourteen, an old hand at justice.
   It seemed colder on the long ride back to Winterfell, though the wind had died by then and the sun was higher in the sky. Bran rode with his brothers, well ahead of the main party, his pony struggling hard to keep up with their horses.
   ¡°The deserter died bravely,¡± Robb said. He was big and broad and growing every day, with his mother¡¯s coloring, the fair skin, red-brown hair, and blue eyes of the Tullys of Riverrun. ¡°He had courage, at the least.¡±
   ¡°No,¡± Jon Snow said quietly. ¡°It was not courage. This one was dead of fear. You could see it in his eyes, Stark.¡± Jon¡¯s eyes were a grey so dark they seemed almost black, but there was little they did not see. He was of an age with Robb, but they did not look alike. Jon was slender where Robb was muscular, dark where Robb was fair, graceful and quick where his half brother was strong and fast.
   Robb was not impressed. ¡°The Others take his eyes,¡± he swore. ¡°He died well. Race you to the bridge?¡±
   ¡°Done,¡± Jon said, kicking his horse forward. Robb cursed and followed, and they galloped off down the trail, Robb laughing and hooting, Jon silent and intent. The hooves of their horses kicked up showers of snow as they went.
   Bran did not try to follow. His pony could not keep up. He had seen the ragged man¡¯s eyes, and he was thinking of them now. After a while, the sound of Robb¡¯s laughter receded, and the woods grew silent again.
   So deep in thought was he that he never heard the rest of the party until his father moved up to ride beside him. ¡°Are you well, Bran?¡± he asked, not unkindly.
   ¡°Yes, Father,¡± Bran told him. He looked up. Wrapped in his furs and leathers, mounted on his great warhorse, his lord father loomed over him like a giant. ¡°Robb says the man died bravely, but Jon says he was afraid.¡±
   ¡°What do you think?¡± his father asked.
   Bran thought about it. ¡°Can a man still be brave if he¡¯s afraid?¡±
   ¡°That is the only time a man can be brave,¡± his father told him. ¡°Do you understand why I did it?¡±
   ¡°He was a wildling,¡± Bran said. ¡°They carry off women and sell them to the Others.¡±
   His lord father smiled. ¡°Old Nan has been telling you stories again. In truth, the man was an oathbreaker, a deserter from the Night¡¯s Watch. No man is more dangerous. The deserter knows his life is forfeit if he is taken, so he will not flinch from any crime, no matter how vile. But you mistake me. The question was not why the man had to die, but why I must do it.¡±
   Bran had no answer for that. ¡°King Robert has a headsman,¡± he said, uncertainly.
   ¡°He does,¡± his father admitted. ¡°As did the Targaryen kings before him. Yet our way is the older way. The blood of the First Men still flows in the veins of the Starks, and we hold to the belief that the man who passes the sentence should swing the sword. If you would take a man¡¯s life, you owe it to him to look into his eyes and hear his final words. And if you cannot bear to do that, then perhaps the man does not deserve to die.
   ¡°One day, Bran, you will be Robb¡¯s bannerman, holding a keep of your own for your brother and your king, and justice will fall to you. When that day comes, you must take no pleasure in the task, but neither must you look away. A ruler who hides behind paid executioners soon forgets what death is.¡±
   That was when Jon reappeared on the crest of the hill before them. He waved and shouted down at them. ¡°Father, Bran, come quickly, see what Robb has found!¡± Then he was gone again.
   Jory rode up beside them. ¡°Trouble, my lord?¡±
   ¡°Beyond a doubt,¡± his lord father said. ¡°Come, let us see what mischief my sons have rooted out now.¡± He sent his horse into a trot. Jory and Bran and the rest came after.
   They found Robb on the riverbank north of the bridge, with Jon still mounted beside him. The late summer snows had been heavy this moonturn. Robb stood knee-deep in white, his hood pulled back so the sun shone in his hair. He was cradling something in his arm, while the boys talked in hushed, excited voices.
   The riders picked their way carefully through the drifts, groping for solid footing on the hidden, uneven ground. Jory Cassel and Theon Greyjoy were the first to reach the boys. Greyjoy was laughing and joking as he rode. Bran heard the breath go out of him. ¡°Gods!¡± he exclaimed, struggling to keep control of his horse as he reached for his sword.
   Jory¡¯s sword was already out. ¡°Robb, get away from it!¡± he called as his horse reared under him.
   Robb grinned and looked up from the bundle in his arms. ¡°She can¡¯t hurt you,¡± he said. ¡°She¡¯s dead, Jory.¡±
   Bran was afire with curiosity by then. He would have spurred the pony faster, but his father made them dismount beside the bridge and approach on foot. Bran jumped off and ran.
   By then Jon, Jory, and Theon Greyjoy had all dismounted as well. ¡°What in the seven hells is it?¡± Greyjoy was saying.
   ¡°A wolf,¡± Robb told him.
   ¡°A freak,¡± Greyjoy said. ¡°Look at the size of it.¡±
   Bran¡¯s heart was thumping in his chest as he pushed through a waist-high drift to his brothers¡¯ side.
   Half-buried in bloodstained snow, a huge dark shape slumped in death. Ice had formed in its shaggy grey fur, and the faint smell of corruption clung to it like a woman¡¯s perfume. Bran glimpsed blind eyes crawling with maggots, a wide mouth full of yellowed teeth. But it was the size of it that made him gasp. It was bigger than his pony, twice the size of the largest hound in his father¡¯s kennel.
   ¡°It¡¯s no freak,¡± Jon said calmly. ¡°That¡¯s a direwolf. They grow larger than the other kind.¡±
   Theon Greyjoy said, ¡°There¡¯s not been a direwolf sighted south of the Wall in two hundred years.¡±
   ¡°I see one now,¡± Jon replied.
   Bran tore his eyes away from the monster. That was when he noticed the bundle in Robb¡¯s arms. He gave a cry of delight and moved closer. The pup was a tiny ball of grey-black fur, its eyes still closed. It nuzzled blindly against Robb¡¯s chest as he cradled it, searching for milk among his leathers, making a sad little whimpery sound. Bran reached out hesitantly. ¡°Go on,¡± Robb told him. ¡°You can touch him.¡±
   Bran gave the pup a quick nervous stroke, then turned as Jon said, ¡°Here you go.¡± His half brother put a second pup into his arms. ¡°There are five of them.¡± Bran sat down in the snow and hugged the wolf pup to his face. Its fur was soft and warm against his cheek.
   ¡°Direwolves loose in the realm, after so many years,¡± muttered Hullen, the master of horse. ¡°I like it not.¡±
   ¡°It is a sign,¡± Jory said.
   Father frowned. ¡°This is only a dead animal, Jory,¡± he said. Yet he seemed troubled. Snow crunched under his boots as he moved around the body. ¡°Do we know what killed her?¡±
   ¡°There¡¯s something in the throat,¡± Robb told him, proud to have found the answer before his father even asked. ¡°There, just under the jaw.¡±
   His father knelt and groped under the beast¡¯s head with his hand. He gave a yank and held it up for all to see. A foot of shattered antler, tines snapped off, all wet with blood.
   A sudden silence descended over the party. The men looked at the antler uneasily, and no one dared to speak. Even Bran could sense their fear, though he did not understand.
   His father tossed the antler to the side and cleansed his hands in the snow. ¡°I¡¯m surprised she lived long enough to whelp,¡± he said. His voice broke the spell.
   ¡°Maybe she didn¡¯t,¡± Jory said. ¡°I¡¯ve heard tales?.?.?.?maybe the bitch was already dead when the pups came.¡±
   ¡°Born with the dead,¡± another man put in. ¡°Worse luck.¡±
   ¡°No matter,¡± said Hullen. ¡°They be dead soon enough too.¡±
   Bran gave a wordless cry of dismay.
   ¡°The sooner the better,¡± Theon Greyjoy agreed. He drew his sword. ¡°Give the beast here, Bran.¡±
   The little thing squirmed against him, as if it heard and understood. ¡°No!¡± Bran cried out fiercely. ¡°It¡¯s mine.¡±
   ¡°Put away your sword, Greyjoy,¡± Robb said. For a moment he sounded as commanding as their father, like the lord he would someday be. ¡°We will keep these pups.¡±
   ¡°You cannot do that, boy,¡± said Harwin, who was Hullen¡¯s son.
   ¡°It be a mercy to kill them,¡± Hullen said.
   Bran looked to his lord father for rescue, but got only a frown, a furrowed brow. ¡°Hullen speaks truly, son. Better a swift death than a hard one from cold and starvation.¡±
   ¡°No!¡± He could feel tears welling in his eyes, and he looked away. He did not want to cry in front of his father.
   Robb resisted stubbornly. ¡°Ser Rodrik¡¯s red bitch whelped again last week,¡± he said. ¡°It was a small litter, only two live pups. She¡¯ll have milk enough.¡±
   ¡°She¡¯ll rip them apart when they try to nurse.¡±
   ¡°Lord Stark,¡± Jon said. It was strange to hear him call Father that, so formal. Bran looked at him with desperate hope. ¡°There are five pups,¡± he told Father. ¡°Three male, two female.¡±
   ¡°What of it, Jon?¡±
   ¡°You have five trueborn children,¡± Jon said. ¡°Three sons, two daughters. The direwolf is the sigil of your House. Your children were meant to have these pups, my lord.¡±
   Bran saw his father¡¯s face change, saw the other men exchange glances. He loved Jon with all his heart at that moment. Even at seven, Bran understood what his brother had done. The count had come right only because Jon had omitted himself. He had included the girls, included even Rickon, the baby, but not the bastard who bore the surname Snow, the name that custom decreed be given to all those in the north unlucky enough to be born with no name of their own.
   Their father understood as well. ¡°You want no pup for yourself, Jon?¡± he asked softly.
   ¡°The direwolf graces the banners of House Stark,¡± Jon pointed out. ¡°I am no Stark, Father.¡±
   Their lord father regarded Jon thoughtfully. Robb rushed into the silence he left. ¡°I will nurse him myself, Father,¡± he promised. ¡°I will soak a towel with warm milk, and give him suck from that.¡±
   ¡°Me too!¡± Bran echoed.
   The lord weighed his sons long and carefully with his eyes. ¡°Easy to say, and harder to do. I will not have you wasting the servants¡¯ time with this. If you want these pups, you will feed them yourselves. Is that understood?¡±
   Bran nodded eagerly. The pup squirmed in his grasp, licked at his face with a warm tongue.
   ¡°You must train them as well,¡± their father said. ¡°You must train them. The kennelmaster will have nothing to do with these monsters, I promise you that. And the gods help you if you neglect them, or brutalize them, or train them badly. These are not dogs to beg for treats and slink off at a kick. A direwolf will rip a man¡¯s arm off his shoulder as easily as a dog will kill a rat. Are you sure you want this?¡±
   ¡°Yes, Father,¡± Bran said.
   ¡°Yes,¡± Robb agreed.
   ¡°The pups may die anyway, despite all you do.¡±
   ¡°They won¡¯t die,¡± Robb said. ¡°We won¡¯t let them die.¡±
   ¡°Keep them, then. Jory, Desmond, gather up the other pups. It¡¯s time we were back to Winterfell.¡±
   It was not until they were mounted and on their way that Bran allowed himself to taste the sweet air of victory. By then, his pup was snuggled inside his leathers, warm against him, safe for the long ride home. Bran was wondering what to name him.
   Halfway across the bridge, Jon pulled up suddenly.
   ¡°What is it, Jon?¡± their lord father asked.
   ¡°Can¡¯t you hear it?¡±
   Bran could hear the wind in the trees, the clatter of their hooves on the ironwood planks, the whimpering of his hungry pup, but Jon was listening to something else.
   ¡°There,¡± Jon said. He swung his horse around and galloped back across the bridge. They watched him dismount where the direwolf lay dead in the snow, watched him kneel. A moment later he was riding back to them, smiling.
   ¡°He must have crawled away from the others,¡± Jon said.
   ¡°Or been driven away,¡± their father said, looking at the sixth pup. His fur was white, where the rest of the litter was grey. His eyes were as red as the blood of the ragged man who had died that morning. Bran thought it curious that this pup alone would have opened his eyes while the others were still blind.
   ¡°An albino,¡± Theon Greyjoy said with wry amusement. ¡°This one will die even faster than the others.¡±
   Jon Snow gave his father¡¯s ward a long, chilling look. ¡°I think not, Greyjoy,¡± he said. ¡°This one belongs to me.¡±
   
   2£®CATELYN
   Catelyn had never liked this godswood.
   She had been born a Tully, at Riverrun far to the south, on the Red Fork of the Trident. The godswood there was a garden, bright and airy, where tall redwoods spread dappled shadows across tinkling streams, birds sang from hidden nests, and the air was spicy with the scent of flowers.
   The gods of Winterfell kept a different sort of wood. It was a dark, primal place, three acres of old forest untouched for ten thousand years as the gloomy castle rose around it. It smelled of moist earth and decay. No redwoods grew here. This was a wood of stubborn sentinel trees armored in grey-green needles, of mighty oaks, of ironwoods as old as the realm itself. Here thick black trunks crowded close together while twisted branches wove a dense canopy overhead and misshappen roots wrestled beneath the soil. This was a place of deep silence and brooding shadows, and the gods who lived here had no names.
   But she knew she would find her husband here tonight. Whenever he took a man¡¯s life, afterward he would seek the quiet of the godswood.
   Catelyn had been anointed with the seven oils and named in the rainbow of light that filled the sept of Riverrun. She was of the Faith, like her father and grandfather and his father before him. Her gods had names, and their faces were as familiar as the faces of her parents. Worship was a septon with a censer, the smell of incense, a seven-sided crystal alive with light, voices raised in song. The Tullys kept a godswood, as all the great houses did, but it was only a place to walk or read or lie in the sun. Worship was for the sept.
   For her sake, Ned had built a small sept where she might sing to the seven faces of god, but the blood of the First Men still flowed in the veins of the Starks, and his own gods were the old ones, the nameless, faceless gods of the greenwood they shared with the vanished children of the forest.
   At the center of the grove an ancient weirwood brooded over a small pool where the waters were black and cold. ¡°The heart tree,¡± Ned called it. The weirwood¡¯s bark was white as bone, its leaves dark red, like a thousand bloodstained hands. A face had been carved in the trunk of the great tree, its features long and melancholy, the deep-cut eyes red with dried sap and strangely watchful. They were old, those eyes; older than Winterfell itself. They had seen Brandon the Builder set the first stone, if the tales were true; they had watched the castle¡¯s granite walls rise around them. It was said that the children of the forest had carved the faces in the trees during the dawn centuries before the coming of the First Men across the narrow sea.
   In the south the last weirwoods had been cut down or burned out a thousand years ago, except on the Isle of Faces where the green men kept their silent watch. Up here it was different. Here every castle had its godswood, and every godswood had its heart tree, and every heart tree its face.
   Catelyn found her husband beneath the weirwood, seated on a moss-covered stone. The greatsword Ice was across his lap, and he was cleaning the blade in those waters black as night. A thousand years of humus lay thick upon the godswood floor, swallowing the sound of her feet, but the red eyes of the weirwood seemed to follow her as she came. ¡°Ned,¡± she called softly.
   He lifted his head to look at her. ¡°Catelyn,¡± he said. His voice was distant and formal. ¡°Where are the children?¡±
   He would always ask her that. ¡°In the kitchen, arguing about names for the wolf pups.¡± She spread her cloak on the forest floor and sat beside the pool, her back to the weirwood. She could feel the eyes watching her, but she did her best to ignore them. ¡°Arya is already in love, and Sansa is charmed and gracious, but Rickon is not quite sure.¡±
   ¡°Is he afraid?¡± Ned asked.
   ¡°A little,¡± she admitted. ¡°He is only three.¡±
   Ned frowned. ¡°He must learn to face his fears. He will not be three forever. And winter is coming.¡±
   ¡°Yes,¡± Catelyn agreed. The words gave her a chill, as they always did. The Stark words. Every noble house had its words. Family mottoes, touchstones, prayers of sorts, they boasted of honor and glory, promised loyalty and truth, swore faith and courage. All but the Starks. Winter is coming, said the Stark words. Not for the first time, she reflected on what a strange people these northerners were.
   ¡°The man died well, I¡¯ll give him that,¡± Ned said. He had a swatch of oiled leather in one hand. He ran it lightly up the greatsword as he spoke, polishing the metal to a dark glow. ¡°I was glad for Bran¡¯s sake. You would have been proud of Bran.¡±
   ¡°I am always proud of Bran,¡± Catelyn replied, watching the sword as he stroked it. She could see the rippling deep within the steel, where the metal had been folded back on itself a hundred times in the forging. Catelyn had no love for swords, but she could not deny that Ice had its own beauty. It had been forged in Valyria, before the Doom had come to the old Freehold, when the ironsmiths had worked their metal with spells as well as hammers. Four hundred years old it was, and as sharp as the day it was forged. The name it bore was older still, a legacy from the age of heroes, when the Starks were Kings in the North.
   ¡°He was the fourth this year,¡± Ned said grimly. ¡°The poor man was half-mad. Something had put a fear in him so deep that my words could not reach him.¡± He sighed. ¡°Ben writes that the strength of the Night¡¯s Watch is down below a thousand. It¡¯s not only desertions. They are losing men on rangings as well.¡±
   ¡°Is it the wildlings?¡± she asked.
   ¡°Who else?¡± Ned lifted Ice, looked down the cool steel length of it. ¡°And it will only grow worse. The day may come when I will have no choice but to call the banners and ride north to deal with this King-beyond-the-Wall for good and all.¡±
   ¡°Beyond the Wall?¡± The thought made Catelyn shudder.
   Ned saw the dread on her face. ¡°Mance Rayder is nothing for us to fear.¡±
   ¡°There are darker things beyond the Wall.¡± She glanced behind her at the heart tree, the pale bark and red eyes, watching, listening, thinking its long slow thoughts.
   His smile was gentle. ¡°You listen to too many of Old Nan¡¯s stories. The Others are as dead as the children of the forest, gone eight thousand years. Maester Luwin will tell you they never lived at all. No living man has ever seen one.¡±
   ¡°Until this morning, no living man had ever seen a direwolf either,¡± Catelyn reminded him.
   ¡°I ought to know better than to argue with a Tully,¡± he said with a rueful smile. He slid Ice back into its sheath. ¡°You did not come here to tell me crib tales. I know how little you like this place. What is it, my lady?¡±
   Catelyn took her husband¡¯s hand. ¡°There was grievous news today, my lord. I did not wish to trouble you until you had cleansed yourself.¡± There was no way to soften the blow, so she told him straight. ¡°I am so sorry, my love. Jon Arryn is dead.¡±
   His eyes found hers, and she could see how hard it took him, as she had known it would. In his youth, Ned had fostered at the Eyrie, and the childless Lord Arryn had become a second father to him and his fellow ward, Robert Baratheon. When the Mad King Aerys II Targaryen had demanded their heads, the Lord of the Eyrie had raised his moon-and-falcon banners in revolt rather than give up those he had pledged to protect.
   And one day fifteen years ago, this second father had become a brother as well, as he and Ned stood together in the sept at Riverrun to wed two sisters, the daughters of Lord Hoster Tully.
   ¡°Jon?.?.?.?¡± he said. ¡°Is this news certain?¡±
   ¡°It was the king¡¯s seal, and the letter is in Robert¡¯s own hand. I saved it for you. He said Lord Arryn was taken quickly. Even Maester Pycelle was helpless, but he brought the milk of the poppy, so Jon did not linger long in pain.¡±
   ¡°That is some small mercy, I suppose,¡± he said. She could see the grief on his face, but even then he thought first of her. ¡°Your sister,¡± he said. ¡°And Jon¡¯s boy. What word of them?¡±
   ¡°The message said only that they were well, and had returned to the Eyrie,¡± Catelyn said. ¡°I wish they had gone to Riverrun instead. The Eyrie is high and lonely, and it was ever her husband¡¯s place, not hers. Lord Jon¡¯s memory will haunt each stone. I know my sister. She needs the comfort of family and friends around her.¡±
   ¡°Your uncle waits in the Vale, does he not? Jon named him Knight of the Gate, I¡¯d heard.¡±
   Catelyn nodded. ¡°Brynden will do what he can for her, and for the boy. That is some comfort, but still?.?.?.?¡±
   ¡°Go to her,¡± Ned urged. ¡°Take the children. Fill her halls with noise and shouts and laughter. That boy of hers needs other children about him, and Lysa should not be alone in her grief.¡±
   ¡°Would that I could,¡± Catelyn said. ¡°The letter had other tidings. The king is riding to Winterfell to seek you out.¡±
   It took Ned a moment to comprehend her words, but when the understanding came, the darkness left his eyes. ¡°Robert is coming here?¡± When she nodded, a smile broke across his face.
   Catelyn wished she could share his joy. But she had heard the talk in the yards; a direwolf dead in the snow, a broken antler in its throat. Dread coiled within her like a snake, but she forced herself to smile at this man she loved, this man who put no faith in signs. ¡°I knew that would please you,¡± she said. ¡°We should send word to your brother on the Wall.¡±
   ¡°Yes, of course,¡± he agreed. ¡°Ben will want to be here. I shall tell Maester Luwin to send his swiftest bird.¡± Ned rose and pulled her to her feet. ¡°Damnation, how many years has it been? And he gives us no more notice than this? How many in his party, did the message say?¡±
   ¡°I should think a hundred knights, at the least, with all their retainers, and half again as many freeriders. Cersei and the children travel with them.¡±
   ¡°Robert will keep an easy pace for their sakes,¡± he said. ¡°It is just as well. That will give us more time to prepare.¡±
   ¡°The queen¡¯s brothers are also in the party,¡± she told him.
   Ned grimaced at that. There was small love between him and the queen¡¯s family, Catelyn knew. The Lannisters of Casterly Rock had come late to Robert¡¯s cause, when victory was all but certain, and he had never forgiven them. ¡°Well, if the price for Robert¡¯s company is an infestation of Lannisters, so be it. It sounds as though Robert is bringing half his court.¡±
   ¡°Where the king goes, the realm follows,¡± she said.
   ¡°It will be good to see the children. The youngest was still sucking at the Lannister woman¡¯s teat the last time I saw him. He must be, what, five by now?¡±
   ¡°Prince Tommen is seven,¡± she told him. ¡°The same age as Bran. Please, Ned, guard your tongue. The Lannister woman is our queen, and her pride is said to grow with every passing year.¡±
   Ned squeezed her hand. ¡°There must be a feast, of course, with singers, and Robert will want to hunt. I shall send Jory south with an honor guard to meet them on the kingsroad and escort them back. Gods, how are we going to feed them all? On his way already, you said? Damn the man. Damn his royal hide.¡±
   
   3£®DAENERYS
   Her brother held the gown up for her inspection. ¡°This is beauty. Touch it. Go on. Caress the fabric.¡±
   Dany touched it. The cloth was so smooth that it seemed to run through her fingers like water. She could not remember ever wearing anything so soft. It frightened her. She pulled her hand away. ¡°Is it really mine?¡±
   ¡°A gift from the Magister Illyrio,¡± Viserys said, smiling. Her brother was in a high mood tonight. ¡°The color will bring out the violet in your eyes. And you shall have gold as well, and jewels of all sorts. Illyrio has promised. Tonight you must look like a princess.¡±
   A princess, Dany thought. She had forgotten what that was like. Perhaps she had never really known. ¡°Why does he give us so much?¡± she asked. ¡°What does he want from us?¡± For nigh on half a year, they had lived in the magister¡¯s house, eating his food, pampered by his servants. Dany was thirteen, old enough to know that such gifts seldom come without their price, here in the free city of Pentos.
   ¡°Illyrio is no fool,¡± Viserys said. He was a gaunt young man with nervous hands and a feverish look in his pale lilac eyes. ¡°The magister knows that I will not forget my friends when I come into my throne.¡±
   Dany said nothing. Magister Illyrio was a dealer in spices, gemstones, dragonbone, and other, less savory things. He had friends in all of the Nine Free Cities, it was said, and even beyond, in Vaes Dothrak and the fabled lands beside the Jade Sea. It was also said that he¡¯d never had a friend he wouldn¡¯t cheerfully sell for the right price. Dany listened to the talk in the streets, and she heard these things, but she knew better than to question her brother when he wove his webs of dream. His anger was a terrible thing when roused. Viserys called it ¡°waking the dragon.¡±
   Her brother hung the gown beside the door. ¡°Illyrio will send the slaves to bathe you. Be sure you wash off the stink of the stables. Khal Drogo has a thousand horses, tonight he looks for a different sort of mount.¡± He studied her critically. ¡°You still slouch. Straighten yourself¡± He pushed back her shoulders with his hands. ¡°Let them see that you have a woman¡¯s shape now.¡± His fingers brushed lightly over her budding breasts and tightened on a nipple. ¡°You will not fail me tonight. If you do, it will go hard for you. You don¡¯t want to wake the dragon, do you?¡± His fingers twisted her, the pinch cruelly hard through the rough fabric of her tunic. ¡°Do you?¡± he repeated.
   ¡°No,¡± Dany said meekly.
   Her brother smiled. ¡°Good.¡± He touched her hair, almost with affection. ¡°When they write the history of my reign, sweet sister, they will say that it began tonight.¡±
   When he was gone, Dany went to her window and looked out wistfully on the waters of the bay. The square brick towers of Pentos were black silhouettes outlined against the setting sun. Dany could hear the singing of the red priests as they lit their night fires and the shouts of ragged children playing games beyond the walls of the estate. For a moment she wished she could be out there with them, barefoot and breathless and dressed in tatters, with no past and no future and no feast to attend at Khal Drogo¡¯s manse.
   Somewhere beyond the sunset, across the narrow sea, lay a land of green hills and flowered plains and great rushing rivers, where towers of dark stone rose amidst magnificent blue-grey mountains, and armored knights rode to battle beneath the banners of their lords. The Dothraki called that land Rhaesh Andahli, the land of the Andals. In the Free Cities, they talked of Westeros and the Sunset Kingdoms. Her brother had a simpler name. ¡°Our land,¡± he called it. The words were like a prayer with him. If he said them enough, the gods were sure to hear. ¡°Ours by blood right, taken from us by treachery, but ours still, ours forever. You do not steal from the dragon, oh, no. The dragon remembers.¡±
   And perhaps the dragon did remember, but Dany could not. She had never seen this land her brother said was theirs, this realm beyond the narrow sea. These places he talked of, Casterly Rock and the Eyrie, Highgarden and the Vale of Arryn, Dorne and the Isle of Faces, they were just words to her. Viserys had been a boy of eight when they fled King¡¯s Landing to escape the advancing armies of the Usurper, but Daenerys had been only a quickening in their mother¡¯s womb.
   Yet sometimes Dany would picture the way it had been, so often had her brother told her the stories. The midnight flight to Dragonstone, moonlight shimmering on the ship¡¯s black sails. Her brother Rhaegar battling the Usurper in the bloody waters of the Trident and dying for the woman he loved. The sack of King¡¯s Landing by the ones Viserys called the Usurper¡¯s dogs, the lords Lannister and Stark. Princess Elia of Dorne pleading for mercy as Rhaegar¡¯s heir was ripped from her breast and murdered before her eyes. The polished skulls of the last dragons staring down sightlessly from the walls of the throne room while the Kingslayer opened Father¡¯s throat with a golden sword.
   She had been born on Dragonstone nine moons after their flight, while a raging summer storm threatened to rip the island fastness apart. They said that storm was terrible. The Targaryen fleet was smashed while it lay at anchor, and huge stone blocks were ripped from the parapets and sent hurtling into the wild waters of the narrow sea. Her mother had died birthing her, and for that her brother Viserys had never forgiven her.
   She did not remember Dragonstone either. They had run again, just before the Usurper¡¯s brother set sail with his new-built fleet. By then only Dragonstone itself, the ancient seat of their House, had remained of the Seven Kingdoms that had once been theirs. It would not remain for long. The garrison had been prepared to sell them to the Usurper, but one night Ser Willem Darry and four loyal men had broken into the nursery and stolen them both, along with her wet nurse, and set sail under cover of darkness for the safety of the Braavosian coast.
   She remembered Ser Willem dimly, a great grey bear of a man, half-blind, roaring and bellowing orders from his sickbed. The servants had lived in terror of him, but he had always been kind to Dany. He called her ¡°Little Princess¡± and sometimes ¡°My Lady,¡± and his hands were soft as old leather. He never left his bed, though, and the smell of sickness clung to him day and night, a hot, moist, sickly sweet odor. That was when they lived in Braavos, in the big house with the red door. Dany had her own room there, with a lemon tree outside her window. After Ser Willem had died, the servants had stolen what little money they had left, and soon after they had been put out of the big house. Dany had cried when the red door closed behind them forever.
   They had wandered since then, from Braavos to Myr, from Myr to Tyrosh, and on to Qohor and Volantis and Lys, never staying long in any one place. Her brother would not allow it. The Usurper¡¯s hired knives were close behind them, he insisted, though Dany had never seen one.
   At first the magisters and archons and merchant princes were pleased to welcome the last Targaryens to their homes and tables, but as the years passed and the Usurper continued to sit upon the Iron Throne, doors closed and their lives grew meaner. Years past they had been forced to sell their last few treasures, and now even the coin they had gotten from Mother¡¯s crown had gone. In the alleys and wine sinks of Pentos, they called her brother ¡°the beggar king.¡± Dany did not want to know what they called her.
   ¡°We will have it all back someday, sweet sister,¡± he would promise her. Sometimes his hands shook when he talked about it. ¡°The jewels and the silks, Dragonstone and King¡¯s Landing, the Iron Throne and the Seven Kingdoms, all they have taken from us, we will have it back.¡± Viserys lived for that day. All that Daenerys wanted back was the big house with the red door, the lemon tree outside her window, the childhood she had never known.
   There came a soft knock on her door. ¡°Come,¡± Dany said, turning away from the window. Illyrio¡¯s servants entered, bowed, and set about their business. They were slaves, a gift from one of the magister¡¯s many Dothraki friends. There was no slavery in the free city of Pentos. Nonetheless, they were slaves. The old woman, small and grey as a mouse, never said a word, but the girl made up for it. She was Illyrio¡¯s favorite, a fair-haired, blue-eyed wench of sixteen who chattered constantly as she worked.
   They filled her bath with hot water brought up from the kitchen and scented it with fragrant oils. The girl pulled the rough cotton tunic over Dany¡¯s head and helped her into the tub. The water was scalding hot, but Daenerys did not flinch or cry out. She liked the heat. It made her feel clean. Besides, her brother had often told her that it was never too hot for a Targaryen. ¡°Ours is the house of the dragon,¡± he would say. ¡°The fire is in our blood.¡±
   The old woman washed her long, silver-pale hair and gently combed out the snags, all in silence. The girl scrubbed her back and her feet and told her how lucky she was. ¡°Drogo is so rich that even his slaves wear golden collars. A hundred thousand men ride in his khalasar, and his palace in Vaes Dothrak has two hundred rooms and doors of solid silver.¡± There was more like that, so much more, what a handsome man the khal was, so tall and fierce, fearless in battle, the best rider ever to mount a horse, a demon archer. Daenerys said nothing. She had always assumed that she would wed Viserys when she came of age. For centuries the Targaryens had married brother to sister, since Aegon the Conqueror had taken his sisters to bride. The line must be kept pure, Viserys had told her a thousand times; theirs was the kingsblood, the golden blood of old Valyria, the blood of the dragon. Dragons did not mate with the beasts of the field, and Targaryens did not mingle their blood with that of lesser men. Yet now Viserys schemed to sell her to a stranger, a barbarian.
   When she was clean, the slaves helped her from the water and toweled her dry. The girl brushed her hair until it shone like molten silver, while the old woman anointed her with the spiceflower perfume of the Dothraki plains, a dab on each wrist, behind her ears, on the tips of her breasts, and one last one, cool on her lips, down there between her legs. They dressed her in the wisps that Magister Illyrio had sent up, and then the gown, a deep plum silk to bring out the violet in her eyes. The girl slid the gilded sandals onto her feet, while the old woman fixed the tiara in her hair, and slid golden bracelets crusted with amethysts around her wrists. Last of all came the collar, a heavy golden torc emblazoned with ancient Valyrian glyphs.
   ¡°Now you look all a princess,¡± the girl said breathlessly when they were done. Dany glanced at her image in the silvered looking glass that Illyrio had so thoughtfully provided. A princess, she thought, but she remembered what the girl had said, how Khal Drogo was so rich even his slaves wore golden collars. She felt a sudden chill, and gooseflesh pimpled her bare arms.
   Her brother was waiting in the cool of the entry hall, seated on the edge of the pool, his hand trailing in the water. He rose when she appeared and looked her over critically. ¡°Stand there,¡± he told her. ¡°Turn around. Yes. Good. You look ?.?.?.?¡±
   ¡°Regal,¡± Magister Illyrio said, stepping through an archway. He moved with surprising delicacy for such a massive man. Beneath loose garments of flame-colored silk, rolls of fat jiggled as he walked. Gemstones glittered on every finger, and his man had oiled his forked yellow beard until it shone like real gold. ¡°May the Lord of Light shower you with blessings on this most fortunate day, Princess Daenerys,¡± the magister said as he took her hand. He bowed his head, showing a thin glimpse of crooked yellow teeth through the gold of his beard. ¡°She is a vision, Your Grace, a vision,¡± he told her brother. ¡°Drogo will be enraptured.¡±
   ¡°She¡¯s too skinny,¡± Viserys said. His hair, the same silver-blond as hers, had been pulled back tightly behind his head and fastened with a dragonbone brooch. It was a severe look that emphasized the hard, gaunt lines of his face. He rested his hand on the hilt of the sword that Illyrio had lent him, and said, ¡°Are you sure that Khal Drogo likes his women this young?¡±
   ¡°She has had her blood. She is old enough for the khal,¡± Illyrio told him, not for the first time. ¡°Look at her. That silver-gold hair, those purple eyes?.?.?.?she is the blood of old Valyria, no doubt, no doubt?.?.?.?and highborn, daughter of the old king, sister to the new, she cannot fail to entrance our Drogo.¡± When he released her hand, Daenerys found herself trembling.
   ¡°I suppose,¡± her brother said doubtfully. ¡°The savages have queer tastes. Boys, horses, sheep?.?.?.?¡±
   ¡°Best not suggest this to Khal Drogo,¡± Illyrio said.
   Anger flashed in her brother¡¯s lilac eyes. ¡°Do you take me for a fool?¡±
   The magister bowed slightly. ¡°I take you for a king. Kings lack the caution of common men. My apologies if I have given offense.¡± He turned away and clapped his hands for his bearers.
   The streets of Pentos were pitch-dark when they set out in Illyrio¡¯s elaborately carved palanquin. Two servants went ahead to light their way, carrying ornate oil lanterns with panes of pale blue glass, while a dozen strong men hoisted the poles to their shoulders. It was warm and close inside behind the curtains. Dany could smell the stench of Illyrio¡¯s pallid flesh through his heavy perfumes.
   Her brother, sprawled out on his pillows beside her, never noticed. His mind was away across the narrow sea. ¡°We won¡¯t need his whole khalasar,¡± Viserys said. His fingers toyed with the hilt of his borrowed blade, though Dany knew he had never used a sword in earnest. ¡°Ten thousand, that would be enough, I could sweep the Seven Kingdoms with ten thousand Dothraki screamers. The realm will rise for its rightful king. Tyrell, Redwyne, Darry, Greyjoy, they have no more love for the Usurper than I do. The Dornishmen burn to avenge Elia and her children. And the smallfolk will be with us. They cry out for their king.¡± He looked at Illyrio anxiously. ¡°They do, don¡¯t they?¡±
   ¡°They are your people, and they love you well,¡± Magister Illyrio said amiably. ¡°In holdfasts all across the realm, men lift secret toasts to your health while women sew dragon banners and hide them against the day of your return from across the water.¡± He gave a massive shrug. ¡°Or so my agents tell me.¡±
   Dany had no agents, no way of knowing what anyone was doing or thinking across the narrow sea, but she mistrusted Illyrio¡¯s sweet words as she mistrusted everything about Illyrio. Her brother was nodding eagerly, however. ¡°I shall kill the Usurper myself,¡± he promised, who had never killed anyone, ¡°as he killed my brother Rhaegar. And Lannister too, the Kingslayer, for what he did to my father.¡±
   ¡°That would be most fitting,¡± Magister Illyrio said. Dany saw the smallest hint of a smile playing around his full lips, but her brother did not notice. Nodding, he pushed back a curtain and stared off into the night, and Dany knew he was fighting the Battle of the Trident once again.
   The nine-towered manse of Khal Drogo sat beside the waters of the bay, its high brick walls overgrown with pale ivy. It had been given to the khal by the magisters of Pentos, Illyrio told them. The Free Cities were always generous with the horselords. ¡°It is not that we fear these barbarians,¡± Illyrio would explain with a smile. ¡°The Lord of Light would hold our city walls against a million Dothraki, or so the red priests promise?.?.?.?yet why take chances, when their friendship comes so cheap?¡±
   Their palanquin was stopped at the gate, the curtains pulled roughly back by one of the house guards. He had the copper skin and dark almond eyes of a Dothraki, but his face was hairless and he wore the spiked bronze cap of the Unsullied. He looked them over coldly. Magister Illyrio growled something to him in the rough Dothraki tongue; the guardsman replied in the same voice and waved them through the gates.
   Dany noticed that her brother¡¯s hand was clenched tightly around the hilt of his borrowed sword. He looked almost as frightened as she felt. ¡°Insolent eunuch,¡± Viserys muttered as the palanquin lurched up toward the manse.
   Magister Illyrio¡¯s words were honey. ¡°Many important men will be at the feast tonight. Such men have enemies. The khal must protect his guests, yourself chief among them, Your Grace. No doubt the Usurper would pay well for your head.¡±
   ¡°Oh, yes,¡± Viserys said darkly. ¡°He has tried, Illyrio, I promise you that. His hired knives follow us everywhere. I am the last dragon, and he will not sleep easy while I live.¡±
   The palanquin slowed and stopped. The curtains were thrown back, and a slave offered a hand to help Daenerys out. His collar, she noted, was ordinary bronze. Her brother followed, one hand still clenched hard around his sword hilt. It took two strong men to get Magister Illyrio back on his feet.
   Inside the manse, the air was heavy with the scent of spices, pinchfire and sweet lemon and cinnamon. They were escorted across the entry hall, where a mosaic of colored glass depicted the Doom of Valyria. Oil burned in black iron lanterns all along the walls. Beneath an arch of twining stone leaves, a eunuch sang their coming. ¡°Viserys of the House Targaryen, the Third of his Name,¡± he called in a high, sweet voice, ¡°King of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm. His sister, Daenerys Stormborn, Princess of Dragonstone. His honorable host, Illyrio Mopatis, Magister of the Free City of Pentos.¡±
   They stepped past the eunuch into a pillared courtyard overgrown in pale ivy. Moonlight painted the leaves in shades of bone and silver as the guests drifted among them. Many were Dothraki horselords, big men with red-brown skin, their drooping mustachios bound in metal rings, their black hair oiled and braided and hung with bells. Yet among them moved bravos and sellswords from Pentos and Myr and Tyrosh, a red priest even fatter than Illyrio, hairy men from the Port of Ibben, and lords from the Summer Isles with skin as black as ebony. Daenerys looked at them all in wonder?.?.?.?and realized, with a sudden start of fear, that she was the only woman there.
   Illyrio whispered to them. ¡°Those three are Drogo¡¯s bloodriders, there,¡± he said. ¡°By the pillar is Khal Moro, with his son Rhogoro. The man with the green beard is brother to the Archon of Tyrosh, and the man behind him is Ser Jorah Mormont.¡±
   The last name caught Daenerys. ¡°A knight?¡±
   ¡°No less.¡± Illyrio smiled through his beard. ¡°Anointed with the seven oils by the High Septon himself.¡±
   ¡°What is he doing here?¡± she blurted.
   ¡°The Usurper wanted his head,¡± Illyrio told them. ¡°Some trifling affront. He sold some poachers to a Tyroshi slaver instead of giving them to the Night¡¯s Watch. Absurd law. A man should be able to do as he likes with his own chattel.¡±
   ¡°I shall wish to speak with Ser Jorah before the night is done,¡± her brother said. Dany found herself looking at the knight curiously. He was an older man, past forty and balding, but still strong and fit. Instead of silks and cottons, he wore wool and leather. His tunic was a dark green, embroidered with the likeness of a black bear standing on two legs.
   She was still looking at this strange man from the homeland she had never known when Magister Illyrio placed a moist hand on her bare shoulder. ¡°Over there, sweet princess,¡± he whispered, ¡°there is the khal himself.¡±
   Dany wanted to run and hide, but her brother was looking at her, and if she displeased him she knew she would wake the dragon. Anxiously, she turned and looked at the man Viserys hoped would ask to wed her before the night was done.
   The slave girl had not been far wrong, she thought. Khal Drogo was a head taller than the tallest man in the room, yet somehow light on his feet, as graceful as the panther in Illyrio¡¯s menagerie. He was younger than she¡¯d thought, no more than thirty. His skin was the color of polished copper, his thick mustachios bound with gold and bronze rings.
   ¡°I must go and make my submissions,¡± Magister Illyrio said. ¡°Wait here. I shall bring him to you.¡±
   Her brother took her by the arm as Illyrio waddled over to the khal, his fingers squeezing so hard that they hurt. ¡°Do you see his braid, sweet sister?¡±
   Drogo¡¯s braid was black as midnight and heavy with scented oil, hung with tiny bells that rang softly as he moved. It swung well past his belt, below even his buttocks, the end of it brushing against the back of his thighs.
   ¡°You see how long it is?¡± Viserys said. ¡°When Dothraki are defeated in combat, they cut off their braids in disgrace, so the world will know their shame. Khal Drogo has never lost a fight. He is Aegon the Dragonlord come again, and you will be his queen.¡±
   Dany looked at Khal Drogo. His face was hard and cruel, his eyes as cold and dark as onyx. Her brother hurt her sometimes, when she woke the dragon, but he did not frighten her the way this man frightened her. ¡°I don¡¯t want to be his queen,¡± she heard herself say in a small, thin voice. ¡°Please, please, Viserys, I don¡¯t want to, I want to go home.¡±
   ¡°Home?¡± He kept his voice low, but she could hear the fury in his tone. ¡°How are we to go home, sweet sister? They took our home from us!¡± He drew her into the shadows, out of sight, his fingers digging into her skin. ¡°How are we to go home?¡± he repeated, meaning King¡¯s Landing, and Dragonstone, and all the realm they had lost.
   Dany had only meant their rooms in Illyrio¡¯s estate, no true home surely, though all they had, but her brother did not want to hear that. There was no home there for him. Even the big house with the red door had not been home for him. His fingers dug hard into her arm, demanding an answer. ¡°I don¡¯t know?.?.?.?¡±she said at last, her voice breaking. Tears welled in her eyes.
   ¡°I do,¡± he said sharply. ¡°We go home with an army, sweet sister. With Khal Drogo¡¯s army, that is how we go home. And if you must wed him and bed him for that, you will.¡± He smiled at her. ¡°I¡¯d let his whole khalasar fuck you if need be, sweet sister, all forty thousand men, and their horses too if that was what it took to get my army. Be grateful it is only Drogo. In time you may even learn to like him. Now dry your eyes. Illyrio is bringing him over, and he will not see you crying.¡±
   Dany turned and saw that it was true. Magister Illyrio, all smiles and bows, was escorting Khal Drogo over to where they stood. She brushed away unfallen tears with the back of her hand.
   ¡°Smile,¡± Viserys whispered nervously, his hand failing to the hilt of his sword. ¡°And stand up straight. Let him see that you have breasts. Gods know, you have little enough as is.¡±
   Daenerys smiled, and stood up straight.
   
   4£®EDDARD
   The visitors poured through the castle gates in a river of gold and silver and polished steel, three hundred strong, a pride of bannermen and knights, of sworn swords and freeriders. Over their heads a dozen golden banners whipped back and forth in the northern wind, emblazoned with the crowned stag of Baratheon.
   Ned knew many of the riders. There came Ser Jaime Lannister with hair as bright as beaten gold, and there Sandor Clegane with his terrible burned face. The tall boy beside him could only be the crown prince, and that stunted little man behind them was surely the Imp, Tyrion Lannister.
   Yet the huge man at the head of the column, flanked by two knights in the snow-white cloaks of the Kingsguard, seemed almost a stranger to Ned?.?.?.?until he vaulted off the back of his warhorse with a familiar roar, and crushed him in a bone-crunching hug. ¡°Ned! Ah, but it is good to see that frozen face of yours.¡± The king looked him over top to bottom, and laughed. ¡°You have not changed at all.¡±
   Would that Ned had been able to say the same. Fifteen years past, when they had ridden forth to win a throne, the Lord of Storm¡¯s End had been clean-shaven, clear-eyed, and muscled like a maiden¡¯s fantasy. Six and a half feet tall, he towered over lesser men, and when he donned his armor and the great antlered helmet of his House, he became a veritable giant. He¡¯d had a giant¡¯s strength too, his weapon of choice a spiked iron warhammer that Ned could scarcely lift. In those days, the smell of leather and blood had clung to him like perfume.
   Now it was perfume that clung to him like perfume, and he had a girth to match his height. Ned had last seen the king nine years before during Balon Greyjoy¡¯s rebellion, when the stag and the direwolf had joined to end the pretensions of the self-proclaimed King of the Iron Islands. Since the night they had stood side by side in Greyjoy¡¯s fallen stronghold, where Robert had accepted the rebel lord¡¯s surrender and Ned had taken his son Theon as hostage and ward, the king had gained at least eight stone. A beard as coarse and black as iron wire covered his jaw to hide his double chin and the sag of the royal jowls, but nothing could hide his stomach or the dark circles under his eyes.
   Yet Robert was Ned¡¯s king now, and not just a friend, so he said only, ¡°Your Grace. Winterfell is yours.¡±
   By then the others were dismounting as well, and grooms were coming forward for their mounts. Robert¡¯s queen, Cersei Lannister, entered on foot with her younger children. The wheelhouse in which they had ridden, a huge double-decked carriage of oiled oak and gilded metal pulled by forty heavy draft horses, was too wide to pass through the castle gate. Ned knelt in the snow to kiss the queen¡¯s ring, while Robert embraced Catelyn like a long-lost sister. Then the children had been brought forward, introduced, and approved of by both sides.
   No sooner had those formalities of greeting been completed than the king had said to his host, ¡°Take me down to your crypt, Eddard. I would pay my respects.¡±
   Ned loved him for that, for remembering her still after all these years. He called for a lantern. No other words were needed. The queen had begun to protest. They had been riding since dawn, everyone was tired and cold, surely they should refresh themselves first. The dead would wait. She had said no more than that; Robert had looked at her, and her twin brother Jaime had taken her quietly by the arm, and she had said no more.
   They went down to the crypt together, Ned and this king he scarcely recognized. The winding stone steps were narrow. Ned went first with the lantern. ¡°I was starting to think we would never reach Winterfell,¡± Robert complained as they descended. ¡°In the south, the way they talk about my Seven Kingdoms, a man forgets that your part is as big as the other six combined.¡±
   ¡°I trust you enjoyed the journey, Your Grace?¡±
   Robert snorted. ¡°Bogs and forests and fields, and scarcely a decent inn north of the Neck. I¡¯ve never seen such a vast emptiness. Where are all your people?¡±
   ¡°Likely they were too shy to come out,¡± Ned jested. He could feel the chill coming up the stairs, a cold breath from deep within the earth. ¡°Kings are a rare sight in the north.¡±
   Robert snorted. ¡°More likely they were hiding under the snow. Snow, Ned!¡± The king put one hand on the wall to steady himself as they descended.
   ¡°Late summer snows are common enough,¡± Ned said. ¡°I hope they did not trouble you. They are usually mild.¡±
   ¡°The Others take your mild snows,¡± Robert swore. ¡°What will this place be like in winter? I shudder to think.¡±
   ¡°The winters are hard,¡± Ned admitted. ¡°But the Starks will endure. We always have.¡±
   ¡°You need to come south,¡± Robert told him. ¡°You need a taste of summer before it flees. In Highgarden there are fields of golden roses that stretch away as far as the eye can see. The fruits are so ripe they explode in your mouth, melons, peaches, fireplums, you¡¯ve never tasted such sweetness. You¡¯ll see, I brought you some. Even at Storm¡¯s End, with that good wind off the bay, the days are so hot you can barely move. And you ought to see the towns, Ned! Flowers everywhere, the markets bursting with food, the summerwines so cheap and so good that you can get drunk just breathing the air. Everyone is fat and drunk and rich.¡± He laughed and slapped his own ample stomach a thump. ¡°And the girls, Ned!¡± he exclaimed, his eyes sparkling. ¡°I swear, women lose all modesty in the heat. They swim naked in the river, right beneath the castle. Even in the streets, it¡¯s too damn hot for wool or fur, so they go around in these short gowns, silk if they have the silver and cotton if not, but it¡¯s all the same when they start sweating and the cloth sticks to their skin, they might as well be naked.¡± The king laughed happily.
   Robert Baratheon had always been a man of huge appetites, a man who knew how to take his pleasures. That was not a charge anyone could lay at the door of Eddard Stark. Yet Ned could not help but notice that those pleasures were taking a toll on the king. Robert was breathing heavily by the time they reached the bottom of the stairs, his face red in the lantern light as they stepped out into the darkness of the crypt.
   ¡°Your Grace,¡± Ned said respectfully. He swept the lantern in a wide semicircle. Shadows moved and lurched. Flickering light touched the stones underfoot and brushed against a long procession of granite pillars that marched ahead, two by two, into the dark. Between the pillars, the dead sat on their stone thrones against the walls, backs against the sepulchres that contained their mortal remains. ¡°She is down at the end, with Father and Brandon.¡±
   He led the way between the pillars and Robert followed wordlessly, shivering in the subterranean chill. It was always cold down here. Their footsteps rang off the stones and echoed in the vault overhead as they walked among the dead of House Stark. The Lords of Winterfell watched them pass. Their likenesses were carved into the stones that sealed the tombs. In long rows they sat, blind eyes staring out into eternal darkness, while great stone direwolves curled round their feet. The shifting shadows made the stone figures seem to stir as the living passed by.
   By ancient custom an iron longsword had been laid across the lap of each who had been Lord of Winterfell, to keep the vengeful spirits in their crypts. The oldest had long ago rusted away to nothing, leaving only a few red stains where the metal had rested on stone. Ned wondered if that meant those ghosts were free to roam the castle now. He hoped not. The first Lords of Winterfell had been men hard as the land they ruled. In the centuries before the Dragonlords came over the sea, they had sworn allegiance to no man, styling themselves the Kings in the North.
   Ned stopped at last and lifted the oil lantern. The crypt continued on into darkness ahead of them, but beyond this point the tombs were empty and unsealed; black holes waiting for their dead, waiting for him and his children. Ned did not like to think on that. ¡°Here,¡± he told his king.
   Robert nodded silently, knelt, and bowed his head.
   There were three tombs, side by side. Lord Rickard Stark, Ned¡¯s father, had a long, stern face. The stonemason had known him well. He sat with quiet dignity, stone fingers holding tight to the sword across his lap, but in life all swords had failed him. In two smaller sepulchres on either side were his children.
   Brandon had been twenty when he died, strangled by order of the Mad King Aerys Targaryen only a few short days before he was to wed Catelyn Tully of Riverrun. His father had been forced to watch him die. He was the true heir, the eldest, born to rule.
   Lyanna had only been sixteen, a child-woman of surpassing loveliness. Ned had loved her with all his heart. Robert had loved her even more. She was to have been his bride.
   ¡°She was more beautiful than that,¡± the king said after a silence. His eyes lingered on Lyanna¡¯s face, as if he could will her back to life. Finally he rose, made awkward by his weight. ¡°Ah, damn it, Ned, did you have to bury her in a place like this?¡± His voice was hoarse with remembered grief. ¡°She deserved more than darkness?.?.?.?¡±
   ¡°She was a Stark of Winterfell,¡± Ned said quietly. ¡°This is her place.¡±
   ¡°She should be on a hill somewhere, under a fruit tree, with the sun and clouds above her and the rain to wash her clean.¡±
   ¡°I was with her when she died,¡± Ned reminded the king. ¡°She wanted to come home, to rest beside Brandon and Father.¡± He could hear her still at times. Promise me, she had cried, in a room that smelled of blood and roses. Promise me, Ned. The fever had taken her strength and her voice had been faint as a whisper, but when he gave her his word, the fear had gone out of his sister¡¯s eyes. Ned remembered the way she had smiled then, how tightly her fingers had clutched his as she gave up her hold on life, the rose petals spilling from her palm, dead and black. After that he remembered nothing. They had found him still holding her body, silent with grief. The little crannogman, Howland Reed, had taken her hand from his. Ned could recall none of it. ¡°I bring her flowers when I can,¡± he said. ¡°Lyanna was?.?.?.?fond of flowers.¡±
   The king touched her cheek, his fingers brushing across the rough stone as gently as if it were living flesh. ¡°I vowed to kill Rhaegar for what he did to her.¡±
   ¡°You did,¡± Ned reminded him.
   ¡°Only once,¡± Robert said bitterly.
   They had come together at the ford of the Trident while the battle crashed around them, Robert with his warhammer and his great antlered helm, the Targaryen prince armored all in black. On his breastplate was the three-headed dragon of his House, wrought all in rubies that flashed like fire in the sunlight. The waters of the Trident ran red around the hooves of their destriers as they circled and clashed, again and again, until at last a crushing blow from Robert¡¯s hammer stove in the dragon and the chest beneath it. When Ned had finally come on the scene, Rhaegar lay dead in the stream, while men of both armies scrabbled in the swirling waters for rubies knocked free of his armor.
   ¡°In my dreams, I kill him every night,¡± Robert admitted. ¡°A thousand deaths will still be less than he deserves.¡±
   There was nothing Ned could say to that. After a quiet, he said, ¡°We should return, Your Grace. Your wife will be waiting.¡±
   ¡°The Others take my wife,¡± Robert muttered sourly, but he started back the way they had come, his footsteps falling heavily. ¡°And if I hear ¡®Your Grace¡¯ once more, I¡¯ll have your head on a spike. We are more to each other than that.¡±
   ¡°I had not forgotten,¡± Ned replied quietly. When the king did not answer, he said, ¡°Tell me about Jon.¡±
   Robert shook his head. ¡°I have never seen a man sicken so quickly. We gave a tourney on my son¡¯s name day. If you had seen Jon then, you would have sworn he would live forever. A fortnight later he was dead. The sickness was like a fire in his gut. It burned right through him.¡± He paused beside a pillar, before the tomb of a long-dead Stark. ¡°I loved that old man.¡±
   ¡°We both did.¡± Ned paused a moment. ¡°Catelyn fears for her sister. How does Lysa bear her grief?¡±
   Robert¡¯s mouth gave a bitter twist. ¡°Not well, in truth,¡± he admitted. ¡°I think losing Jon has driven the woman mad, Ned. She has taken the boy back to the Eyrie. Against my wishes. I had hoped to foster him with Tywin Lannister at Casterly Rock. Jon had no brothers, no other sons. Was I supposed to leave him to be raised by women?¡±
   Ned would sooner entrust a child to a pit viper than to Lord Tywin, but he left his doubts unspoken. Some old wounds never truly heal, and bleed again at the slightest word. ¡°The wife has lost the husband,¡± he said carefully. ¡°Perhaps the mother feared to lose the son. The boy is very young.¡±
   ¡°Six, and sickly, and Lord of the Eyrie, gods have mercy,¡± the king swore. ¡°Lord Tywin had never taken a ward before. Lysa ought to have been honored. The Lannisters are a great and noble House. She refused to even hear of it. Then she left in the dead of night, without so much as a by-your-leave. Cersei was furious.¡± He sighed deeply. ¡°The boy is my namesake, did you know that? Robert Arryn. I am sworn to protect him. How can I do that if his mother steals him away?¡±
   ¡°I will take him as ward, if you wish,¡± Ned said. ¡°Lysa should consent to that. She and Catelyn were close as girls, and she would be welcome here as well.¡±
   ¡°A generous offer, my friend,¡± the king said, ¡°but too late. Lord Tywin has already given his consent. Fostering the boy elsewhere would be a grievous affront to him.¡±
   ¡°I have more concern for my nephew¡¯s welfare than I do for Lannister pride,¡± Ned declared.
   ¡°That is because you do not sleep with a Lannister.¡± Robert laughed, the sound rattling among the tombs and bouncing from the vaulted ceiling. His smile was a flash of white teeth in the thicket of the huge black beard. ¡°Ah, Ned,¡± he said, ¡°you are still too serious.¡± He put a massive arm around Ned¡¯s shoulders. ¡°I had planned to wait a few days to speak to you, but I see now there¡¯s no need for it. Come, walk with me.¡±
   They started back down between the pillars. Blind stone eyes seemed to follow them as they passed. The king kept his arm around Ned¡¯s shoulder. ¡°You must have wondered why I finally came north to Winterfell, after so long.¡±
   Ned had his suspicions, but he did not give them voice. ¡°For the joy of my company, surely,¡± he said lightly. ¡°And there is the Wall. You need to see it, Your Grace, to walk along its battlements and talk to those who man it. The Night¡¯s Watch is a shadow of what it once was. Benjen says...¡±
   ¡°No doubt I will hear what your brother says soon enough,¡± Robert said. ¡°The Wall has stood for what, eight thousand years? It can keep a few days more. I have more pressing concerns. These are difficult times. I need good men about me. Men like Jon Arryn. He served as Lord of the Eyrie, as Warden of the East, as the Hand of the King. He will not be easy to replace.¡±
   ¡°His son?.?.?.?¡± Ned began.
   ¡°His son will succeed to the Eyrie and all its incomes,¡± Robert said brusquely. ¡°No more.¡±
   That took Ned by surprise. He stopped, startled, and turned to look at his king. The words came unbidden. ¡°The Arryns have always been Wardens of the East. The title goes with the domain.¡±
   ¡°Perhaps when he comes of age, the honor can be restored to him,¡± Robert said. ¡°I have this year to think of, and next. A six-year-old boy is no war leader, Ned.¡±
   ¡°In peace, the title is only an honor. Let the boy keep it. For his father¡¯s sake if not his own. Surely you owe Jon that much for his service.¡±
   The king was not pleased. He took his arm from around Ned¡¯s shoulders. ¡°Jon¡¯s service was the duty he owed his liege lord. I am not ungrateful, Ned. You of all men ought to know that. But the son is not the father. A mere boy cannot hold the east.¡± Then his tone softened. ¡°Enough of this. There is a more important office to discuss, and I would not argue with you.¡± Robert grasped Ned by the elbow. ¡°I have need of you, Ned.¡±
   ¡°I am yours to command, Your Grace. Always.¡± They were words he had to say, and so he said them, apprehensive about what might come next.
   Robert scarcely seemed to hear him. ¡°Those years we spent in the Eyrie?.?.?.?gods, those were good years. I want you at my side again, Ned. I want you down in King¡¯s Landing, not up here at the end of the world where you are no damned use to anybody.¡± Robert looked off into the darkness, for a moment as melancholy as a Stark. ¡°I swear to you, sitting a throne is a thousand times harder than winning one. Laws are a tedious business and counting coppers is worse. And the people?.?.?.?there is no end of them. I sit on that damnable iron chair and listen to them complain until my mind is numb and my ass is raw. They all want something, money or land or justice. The lies they tell?.?.?.?and my lords and ladies are no better. I am surrounded by flatterers and fools. It can drive a man to madness, Ned. Half of them don¡¯t dare tell me the truth, and the other half can¡¯t find it. There are nights I wish we had lost at the Trident. Ah, no, not truly, but?.?.?.?
   ¡°I understand,¡± Ned said softly.
   Robert looked at him. ¡°I think you do. If so, you are the only one, my old friend.¡± He smiled. ¡°Lord Eddard Stark, I would name you the Hand of the King.¡±
   Ned dropped to one knee. The offer did not surprise him; what other reason could Robert have had for coming so far? The Hand of the King was the second-most powerful man in the Seven Kingdoms. He spoke with the king¡¯s voice, commanded the king¡¯s armies, drafted the king¡¯s laws. At times he even sat upon the Iron Throne to dispense king¡¯s justice, when the king was absent, or sick, or otherwise indisposed. Robert was offering him a responsibility as large as the realm itself.
   It was the last thing in the world he wanted.
   ¡°Your Grace,¡± he said. ¡°I am not worthy of the honor.¡±
   Robert groaned with good-humored impatience. ¡°If I wanted to honor you, I¡¯d let you retire. I am planning to make you run the kingdom and fight the wars while I eat and drink and wench myself into an early grave.¡± He slapped his gut and grinned. ¡°You know the saying, about the king and his Hand?¡±
   Ned knew the saying. ¡°What the king dreams,¡± he said, ¡°the Hand builds.¡±
   ¡°I bedded a fishmaid once who told me the lowborn have a choicer way to put it. The king eats, they say, and the Hand takes the shit.¡± He threw back his head and roared his laughter. The echoes rang through the darkness, and all around them the dead of Winterfell seemed to watch with cold and disapproving eyes.
   Finally the laughter dwindled and stopped. Ned was still on one knee, his eyes upraised. ¡°Damn it, Ned,¡± the king complained. ¡°You might at least humor me with a smile.¡±
   ¡°They say it grows so cold up here in winter that a man¡¯s laughter freezes in his throat and chokes him to death,¡± Ned said evenly. ¡°Perhaps that is why the Starks have so little humor.¡±
   ¡°Come south with me, and I¡¯ll teach you how to laugh again,¡± the king promised. ¡°You helped me win this damnable throne, now help me hold it. We were meant to rule together. If Lyanna had lived, we should have been brothers, bound by blood as well as affection. Well, it is not too late. I have a son. You have a daughter. My Joff and your Sansa shall join our houses, as Lyanna and I might once have done.¡±
   This offer did surprise him. ¡°Sansa is only eleven.¡±
   Robert waved an impatient hand. ¡°Old enough for betrothal. The marriage can wait a few years.¡± The king smiled. ¡°Now stand up and say yes, curse you.¡±
   ¡°Nothing would give me greater pleasure, Your Grace,¡± Ned answered. He hesitated. ¡°These honors are all so unexpected. May I have some time to consider? I need to tell my wife?.?.?.?¡±
   ¡°Yes, yes, of course, tell Catelyn, sleep on it if you must.¡± The king reached down, clasped Ned by the hand, and pulled him roughly to his feet. ¡°Just don¡¯t keep me waiting too long. I am not the most patient of men.¡±
   For a moment Eddard Stark was filled with a terrible sense of foreboding. This was his place, here in the north. He looked at the stone figures all around them, breathed deep in the chill silence of the crypt. He could feel the eyes of the dead. They were all listening, he knew. And winter was coming.
   
   5£®JON
   There were times, not many, but a few, when Jon Snow was glad he was a bastard. As he filled his wine cup once more from a passing flagon, it struck him that this might be one of them.
   He settled back in his place on the bench among the younger squires and drank. The sweet, fruity taste of summerwine filled his mouth and brought a smile to his lips.
   The Great Hall of Winterfell was hazy with smoke and heavy with the smell of roasted meat and fresh-baked bread. Its grey stone walls were draped with banners. White, gold, crimson: the direwolf of Stark, Baratheon¡¯s crowned stag, the lion of Lannister. A singer was playing the high harp and reciting a ballad, but down at this end of the hall his voice could scarcely be heard above the roar of the fire, the clangor of pewter plates and cups, and the low mutter of a hundred drunken conversations.
   It was the fourth hour of the welcoming feast laid for the king. Jon¡¯s brothers and sisters had been seated with the royal children, beneath the raised platform where Lord and Lady Stark hosted the king and queen. In honor of the occasion, his lord father would doubtless permit each child a glass of wine, but no more than that. Down here on the benches, there was no one to stop Jon drinking as much as he had a thirst for.
   And he was finding that he had a man¡¯s thirst, to the raucous delight of the youths around him, who urged him on every time he drained a glass. They were fine company, and Jon relished the stories they were telling, tales of battle and bedding and the hunt. He was certain that his companions were more entertaining than the king¡¯s offspring. He had sated his curiosity about the visitors when they made their entrance. The procession had passed not a foot from the place he had been given on the bench, and Jon had gotten a good long look at them all.
   His lord father had come first, escorting the queen. She was as beautiful as men said. A jeweled tiara gleamed amidst her long golden hair, its emeralds a perfect match for the green of her eyes. His father helped her up the steps to the dais and led her to her seat, but the queen never so much as looked at him. Even at fourteen, Jon could see through her smile.
   Next had come King Robert himself, with Lady Stark on his arm. The king was a great disappointment to Jon. His father had talked of him often: the peerless Robert Baratheon, demon of the Trident, the fiercest warrior of the realm, a giant among princes. Jon saw only a fat man, red-faced under his beard, sweating through his silks. He walked like a man half in his cups.
   After them came the children. Little Rickon first, managing the long walk with all the dignity a three-year-old could muster. Jon had to urge him on when he stopped to visit. Close behind came Robb, in grey wool trimmed with white, the Stark colors. He had the Princess Myrcella on his arm. She was a wisp of a girl, not quite eight, her hair a cascade of golden curls under a jeweled net. Jon noticed the shy looks she gave Robb as they passed between the tables and the timid way she smiled at him. He decided she was insipid. Robb didn¡¯t even have the sense to realize how stupid she was; he was grinning like a fool.
   His half sisters escorted the royal princes. Arya was paired with plump young Tommen, whose white-blond hair was longer than hers. Sansa, two years older, drew the crown prince, Joffrey Baratheon. He was twelve, younger than Jon or Robb, but taller than either, to Jon¡¯s vast dismay. Prince Joffrey had his sister¡¯s hair and his mother¡¯s deep green eyes. A thick tangle of blond curls dripped down past his golden choker and high velvet collar. Sansa looked radiant as she walked beside him, but Jon did not like Joffrey¡¯s pouty lips or the bored, disdainful way he looked at Winterfell¡¯s Great Hall.
   He was more interested in the pair that came behind him: the queen¡¯s brothers, the Lannisters of Casterly Rock. The Lion and the Imp; there was no mistaking which was which. Ser Jaime Lannister was twin to Queen Cersei; tall and golden, with flashing green eyes and a smile that cut like a knife. He wore crimson silk, high black boots, a black satin cloak. On the breast of his tunic, the lion of his House was embroidered in gold thread, roaring its defiance. They called him the Lion of Lannister to his face and whispered ¡°Kingslayer¡± behind his back.
   Jon found it hard to look away from him. This is what a king should look like, he thought to himself as the man passed.
   Then he saw the other one, waddling along half-hidden by his brother¡¯s side. Tyrion Lannister, the youngest of Lord Tywin¡¯s brood and by far the ugliest. All that the gods had given to Cersei and Jaime, they had denied Tyrion. He was a dwarf, half his brother¡¯s height, struggling to keep pace on stunted legs. His head was too large for his body, with a brute¡¯s squashed-in face beneath a swollen shelf of brow. One green eye and one black one peered out from under a lank fall of hair so blond it seemed white. Jon watched him with fascination.
   The last of the high lords to enter were his uncle, Benjen Stark of the Night¡¯s Watch, and his father¡¯s ward, young Theon Greyjoy. Benjen gave Jon a warm smile as he went by. Theon ignored him utterly, but there was nothing new in that. After all had been seated, toasts were made, thanks were given and returned, and then the feasting began.
   Jon had started drinking then, and he had not stopped.
   Something rubbed against his leg beneath the table. Jon saw red eyes staring up at him. ¡°Hungry again?¡± he asked. There was still half a honeyed chicken in the center of the table. Jon reached out to tear off a leg, then had a better idea. He knifed the bird whole and let the carcass slide to the floor between his legs. Ghost ripped into it in savage silence. His brothers and sisters had not been permitted to bring their wolves to the banquet, but there were more curs than Jon could count at this end of the hall, and no one had said a word about his pup. He told himself he was fortunate in that too.
   His eyes stung. Jon rubbed at them savagely, cursing the smoke. He swallowed another gulp of wine and watched his direwolf devour the chicken.
   Dogs moved between the tables, trailing after the serving girls. One of them, a black mongrel bitch with long yellow eyes, caught a scent of the chicken. She stopped and edged under the bench to get a share. Jon watched the confrontation. The bitch growled low in her throat and moved closer. Ghost looked up, silent, and fixed the dog with those hot red eyes. The bitch snapped an angry challenge. She was three times the size of the direwolf pup. Ghost did not move. He stood over his prize and opened his mouth, baring his fangs. The bitch tensed, barked again, then thought better of this fight. She turned and slunk away, with one last defiant snap to save her pride. Ghost went back to his meal.
   Jon grinned and reached under the table to ruffle the shaggy white fur. The direwolf looked up at him, nipped gently at his hand, then went back to eating.
   ¡°Is this one of the direwolves I¡¯ve heard so much of?¡± a familiar voice asked close at hand.
   Jon looked up happily as his uncle Ben put a hand on his head and ruffled his hair much as Jon had ruffled the wolf¡¯s. ¡°Yes,¡± he said. ¡°His name is Ghost.¡±
   One of the squires interrupted the bawdy story he¡¯d been telling to make room at the table for their lord¡¯s brother. Benjen Stark straddled the bench with long legs and took the wine cup out of Jon¡¯s hand. ¡°Summerwine,¡± he said after a taste. ¡°Nothing so sweet. How many cups have you had, Jon?¡±
   Jon smiled.
   Ben Stark laughed. ¡°As I feared. Ah, well. I believe I was younger than you the first time I got truly and sincerely drunk.¡± He snagged a roasted onion, dripping brown with gravy, from a nearby trencher and bit into it. It crunched.
   His uncle was sharp-featured and gaunt as a mountain crag, but there was always a hint of laughter in his blue-grey eyes. He dressed in black, as befitted a man of the Night¡¯s Watch. Tonight it was rich black velvet, with high leather boots and a wide belt with a silver buckle. A heavy silver chain was looped round his neck. Benjen watched Ghost with amusement as he ate his onion. ¡°A very quiet wolf,¡± he observed.
   ¡°He¡¯s not like the others,¡± Jon said. ¡°He never makes a sound. That¡¯s why I named him Ghost. That, and because he¡¯s white. The others are all dark, grey or black.¡±
   ¡°There are still direwolves beyond the Wall. We hear them on our rangings.¡± Benjen Stark gave Jon a long look. ¡°Don¡¯t you usually eat at table with your brothers?¡±
   ¡°Most times,¡± Jon answered in a flat voice. ¡°But tonight Lady Stark thought it might give insult to the royal family to seat a bastard among them.¡±
   ¡°I see.¡± His uncle glanced over his shoulder at the raised table at the far end of the hall. ¡°My brother does not seem very festive tonight.¡±
   Jon had noticed that too. A bastard had to learn to notice things, to read the truth that people hid behind their eyes. His father was observing all the courtesies, but there was tightness in him that Jon had seldom seen before. He said little, looking out over the hall with hooded eyes, seeing nothing. Two seats away, the king had been drinking heavily all night. His broad face was flushed behind his great black beard. He made many a toast, laughed loudly at every jest, and attacked each dish like a starving man, but beside him the queen seemed as cold as an ice sculpture. ¡°The queen is angry too,¡± Jon told his uncle in a low, quiet voice. ¡°Father took the king down to the crypts this afternoon. The queen didn¡¯t want him to go.¡±
   Benjen gave Jon a careful, measuring look. ¡°You don¡¯t miss much, do you, Jon? We could use a man like you on the Wall.¡±
   Jon swelled with pride. ¡°Robb is a stronger lance than I am, but I¡¯m the better sword, and Hullen says I sit a horse as well as anyone in the castle.¡±
   ¡°Notable achievements.¡±
   ¡°Take me with you when you go back to the Wall,¡± Jon said in a sudden rush. ¡°Father will give me leave to go if you ask him, I know he will.¡±
   Uncle Benjen studied his face carefully. ¡°The Wall is a hard place for a boy, Jon.¡±
   ¡°I am almost a man grown,¡± Jon protested. ¡°I will turn fifteen on my next name day, and Maester Luwin says bastards grow up faster than other children.¡±
   ¡°That¡¯s true enough,¡± Benjen said with a downward twist of his mouth. He took Jon¡¯s cup from the table, filled it fresh from a nearby pitcher, and drank down a long swallow.
   ¡°Daeren Targaryen was only fourteen when he conquered Dorne,¡± Jon said. The Young Dragon was one of his heroes.
   ¡°A conquest that lasted a summer,¡± his uncle pointed out. ¡°Your Boy King lost ten thousand men taking the place, and another fifty trying to hold it. Someone should have told him that war isn¡¯t a game.¡± He took another sip of wine. ¡°Also,¡± he said, wiping his mouth, ¡°Daeren Targaryen was only eighteen when he died. Or have you forgotten that part?¡±
   ¡°I forget nothing,¡± Jon boasted. The wine was making him bold. He tried to sit very straight, to make himself seem taller. ¡°I want to serve in the Night¡¯s Watch, Uncle.¡±
   He had thought on it long and hard, lying abed at night while his brothers slept around him. Robb would someday inherit Winterfell, would command great armies as the Warden of the North. Bran and Rickon would be Robb¡¯s bannermen and rule holdfasts in his name. His sisters Arya and Sansa would marry the heirs of other great houses and go south as mistress of castles of their own. But what place could a bastard hope to earn?
   ¡°You don¡¯t know what you¡¯re asking, Jon. The Night¡¯s Watch is a sworn brotherhood. We have no families. None of us will ever father sons. Our wife is duty. Our mistress is honor.¡±
   ¡°A bastard can have honor too,¡± Jon said. ¡°I am ready to swear your oath.¡±
   ¡°You are a boy of fourteen,¡± Benjen said. ¡°Not a man, not yet. Until you have known a woman, you cannot understand what you would be giving up.¡±
   ¡°I don¡¯t care about that!¡± Jon said hotly.
   ¡°You might, if you knew what it meant,¡± Benjen said. ¡°If you knew what the oath would cost you, you might be less eager to pay the price, son.¡±
   Jon felt anger rise inside him. ¡°I¡¯m not your son!¡±
   Benjen Stark stood up. ¡°More¡¯s the pity.¡± He put a hand on Jon¡¯s shoulder. ¡°Come back to me after you¡¯ve fathered a few bastards of your own, and we¡¯ll see how you feel.¡±
   Jon trembled. ¡°I will never father a bastard,¡± he said carefully. ¡°Never!¡± He spat it out like venom.
   Suddenly he realized that the table had fallen silent, and they were all looking at him. He felt the tears begin to well behind his eyes. He pushed himself to his feet.
   ¡°I must be excused,¡± he said with the last of his dignity. He whirled and bolted before they could see him cry. He must have drunk more wine than he had realized. His feet got tangled under him as he tried to leave, and he lurched sideways into a serving girl and sent a flagon of spiced wine crashing to the floor. Laughter boomed all around him, and Jon felt hot tears on his cheeks. Someone tried to steady him. He wrenched free of their grip and ran, half-blind, for the door. Ghost followed close at his heels, out into the night.
   The yard was quiet and empty. A lone sentry stood high on the battlements of the inner wall, his cloak pulled tight around him against the cold. He looked bored and miserable as he huddled there alone, but Jon would have traded places with him in an instant. Otherwise the castle was dark and deserted. Jon had seen an abandoned holdfast once, a drear place where nothing moved but the wind and the stones kept silent about whatever people had lived there. Winterfell reminded him of that tonight.
   The sounds of music and song spilled through the open windows behind him. They were the last things Jon wanted to hear. He wiped away his tears on the sleeve of his shirt, furious that he had let them fall, and turned to go.
   ¡°Boy,¡± a voice called out to him. Jon turned.
   Tyrion Lannister was sitting on the ledge above the door to the Great Hall, looking for all the world like a gargoyle. The dwarf grinned down at him. ¡°Is that animal a wolf?¡±
   ¡°A direwolf,¡± Jon said. ¡°His name is Ghost.¡± He stared up at the little man, his disappointment suddenly forgotten. ¡°What are you doing up there? Why aren¡¯t you at the feast?¡±
   ¡°Too hot, too noisy, and I¡¯d drunk too much wine,¡± the dwarf told him. ¡°I learned long ago that it is considered rude to vomit on your brother. Might I have a closer look at your wolf?¡±
   Jon hesitated, then nodded slowly. ¡°Can you climb down, or shall I bring a ladder?¡±
   ¡°Oh, bleed that,¡± the little man said. He pushed himself off the ledge into empty air. Jon gasped, then watched with awe as Tyrion Lannister spun around in a tight ball, landed lightly on his hands, then vaulted backward onto his legs.
   Ghost backed away from him uncertainly.
   The dwarf dusted himself off and laughed. ¡°I believe I¡¯ve frightened your wolf. My apologies.¡±
   ¡°He¡¯s not scared,¡± Jon said. He knelt and called out. ¡°Ghost, come here. Come on. That¡¯s it.¡±
   The wolf pup padded closer and nuzzled at Jon¡¯s face, but he kept a wary eye on Tyrion Lannister, and when the dwarf reached out to pet him, he drew back and bared his fangs in a silent snarl. ¡°Shy, isn¡¯t he?¡± Lannister observed.
   ¡°Sit, Ghost,¡± Jon commanded. ¡°That¡¯s it. Keep still.¡± He looked up at the dwarf. ¡°You can touch him now. He won¡¯t move until I tell him to. I¡¯ve been training him.¡±
   ¡°I see,¡± Lannister said. He ruffled the snow-white fur between Ghost¡¯s ears and said, ¡°Nice wolf.¡±
   ¡°If I wasn¡¯t here, he¡¯d tear out your throat,¡± Jon said. It wasn¡¯t actually true yet, but it would be.
   ¡°In that case, you had best stay close,¡± the dwarf said. He cocked his oversized head to one side and looked Jon over with his mismatched eyes. ¡°I am Tyrion Lannister.¡±
   ¡°I know,¡± Jon said. He rose. Standing, he was taller than the dwarf. It made him feel strange.
   ¡°You¡¯re Ned Stark¡¯s bastard, aren¡¯t you?¡±
   Jon felt a coldness pass right through him. He pressed his lips together and said nothing.
   ¡°Did I offend you?¡± Lannister said. ¡°Sorry. Dwarfs don¡¯t have to be tactful. Generations of capering fools in motley have won me the right to dress badly and say any damn thing that comes into my head.¡± He grinned. ¡°You are the bastard, though.¡±
   ¡°Lord Eddard Stark is my father,¡± Jon admitted stiffly.
   Lannister studied his face. ¡°Yes,¡± he said. ¡°I can see it. You have more of the north in you than your brothers.¡±
   ¡°Half brothers,¡± Jon corrected. He was pleased by the dwarf¡¯s comment, but he tried not to let it show.
   ¡°Let me give you some counsel, bastard,¡± Lannister said. ¡°Never forget what you are, for surely the world will not. Make it your strength. Then it can never be your weakness. Armor yourself in it, and it will never be used to hurt you.¡±
   Jon was in no mood for anyone¡¯s counsel. ¡°What do you know about being a bastard?¡±
   ¡°All dwarfs are bastards in their father¡¯s eyes.¡±
   ¡°You are your mother¡¯s trueborn son of Lannister.¡±
   ¡°Am I?¡± the dwarf replied, sardonic. ¡°Do tell my lord father. My mother died birthing me, and he¡¯s never been sure.¡±
   ¡°I don¡¯t even know who my mother was,¡± Jon said.
   ¡°Some woman, no doubt. Most of them are.¡± He favored Jon with a rueful grin. ¡°Remember this, boy. All dwarfs may be bastards, yet not all bastards need be dwarfs.¡± And with that he turned and sauntered back into the feast, whistling a tune. When he opened the door, the light from within threw his shadow clear across the yard, and for just a moment Tyrion Lannister stood tall as a king.
   
   6£®CATELYN
   Of all the rooms in Winterfell¡¯s Great Keep, Catelyn¡¯s bedchambers were the hottest. She seldom had to light a fire. The castle had been built over natural hot springs, and the scalding waters rushed through its walls and chambers like blood through a man¡¯s body, driving the chill from the stone halls, filling the glass gardens with a moist warmth, keeping the earth from freezing. Open pools smoked day and night in a dozen small courtyards. That was a little thing, in summer; in winter, it was the difference between life and death.
   Catelyn¡¯s bath was always hot and steaming, and her walls warm to the touch. The warmth reminded her of Riverrun, of days in the sun with Lysa and Edmure, but Ned could never abide the heat. The Starks were made for the cold, he would tell her, and she would laugh and tell him in that case they had certainly built their castle in the wrong place.
   So when they had finished, Ned rolled off and climbed from her bed, as he had a thousand times before. He crossed the room, pulled back the heavy tapestries, and threw open the high narrow windows one by one, letting the night air into the chamber.
   The wind swirled around him as he stood facing the dark, naked and empty-handed. Catelyn pulled the furs to her chin and watched him. He looked somehow smaller and more vulnerable, like the youth she had wed in the sept at Riverrun, fifteen long years gone. Her loins still ached from the urgency of his lovemaking. It was a good ache. She could feel his seed within her. She prayed that it might quicken there. It had been three years since Rickon. She was not too old. She could give him another son.
   ¡°I will refuse him,¡± Ned said as he turned back to her. His eyes were haunted, his voice thick with doubt.
   Catelyn sat up in the bed. ¡°You cannot. You must not.¡±
   ¡°My duties are here in the north. I have no wish to be Robert¡¯s Hand.¡±
   ¡°He will not understand that. He is a king now, and kings are not like other men. If you refuse to serve him, he will wonder why, and sooner or later he will begin to suspect that you oppose him. Can¡¯t you see the danger that would put us in?¡±
   Ned shook his head, refusing to believe. ¡°Robert would never harm me or any of mine. We were closer than brothers. He loves me. If I refuse him, he will roar and curse and bluster, and in a week we will laugh about it together. I know the man!¡±
   ¡°You knew the man,¡± she said. ¡°The king is a stranger to you.¡± Catelyn remembered the direwolf dead in the snow, the broken antler lodged deep in her throat. She had to make him see. ¡°Pride is everything to a king, my lord. Robert came all this way to see you, to bring you these great honors, you cannot throw them back in his face.¡±
   ¡°Honors?¡± Ned laughed bitterly.
   ¡°In his eyes, yes,¡± she said.
   ¡°And in yours?¡±
   ¡°And in mine,¡± she blazed, angry now. Why couldn¡¯t he see? ¡°He offers his own son in marriage to our daughter, what else would you call that? Sansa might someday be queen. Her sons could rule from the Wall to the mountains of Dorne. What is so wrong with that?¡±
   ¡°Gods, Catelyn, Sansa is only eleven,¡± Ned said. ¡°And Joffrey?.?.?.?Joffrey is?.?.?.?¡±
   She finished for him. ¡°?.?.?.?crown prince, and heir to the Iron Throne. And I was only twelve when my father promised me to your brother Brandon.¡±
   That brought a bitter twist to Ned¡¯s mouth. ¡°Brandon. Yes. Brandon would know what to do. He always did. It was all meant for Brandon. You, Winterfell, everything. He was born to be a King¡¯s Hand and a father to queens. I never asked for this cup to pass to me.¡±
   ¡°Perhaps not,¡± Catelyn said, ¡°but Brandon is dead, and the cup has passed, and you must drink from it, like it or not.¡±
   Ned turned away from her, back to the night. He stood staring out in the darkness, watching the moon and the stars perhaps, or perhaps the sentries on the wall.
   Catelyn softened then, to see his pain. Eddard Stark had married her in Brandon¡¯s place, as custom decreed, but the shadow of his dead brother still lay between them, as did the other, the shadow of the woman he would not name, the woman who had borne him his bastard son.
   She was about to go to him when the knock came at the door, loud and unexpected. Ned turned, frowning. ¡°What is it?¡±
   Desmond¡¯s voice came through the door. ¡°My lord, Maester Luwin is without and begs urgent audience.¡±
   ¡°You told him I had left orders not to be disturbed?¡±
   ¡°Yes, my lord. He insists.¡±
   ¡°Very well. Send him in.¡±
   Ned crossed to the wardrobe and slipped on a heavy robe. Catelyn realized suddenly how cold it had become. She sat up in bed and pulled the furs to her chin. ¡°Perhaps we should close the windows,¡± she suggested.
   Ned nodded absently. Maester Luwin was shown in.
   The maester was a small grey man. His eyes were grey, and quick, and saw much. His hair was grey, what little the years had left him. His robe was grey wool, trimmed with white fur, the Stark colors. Its great floppy sleeves had pockets hidden inside. Luwin was always tucking things into those sleeves and producing other things from them: books, messages, strange artifacts, toys for the children. With all he kept hidden in his sleeves, Catelyn was surprised that Maester Luwin could lift his arms at all.
   The maester waited until the door had closed behind him before he spoke. ¡°My lord,¡± he said to Ned, ¡°pardon for disturbing your rest. I have been left a message.¡±
   Ned looked irritated. ¡°Been left? By whom? Has there been a rider? I was not told.¡±
   ¡°There was no rider, my lord. Only a carved wooden box, left on a table in my observatory while I napped. My servants saw no one, but it must have been brought by someone in the king¡¯s party. We have had no other visitors from the south.¡±
   ¡°A wooden box, you say?¡± Catelyn said.
   ¡°Inside was a fine new lens for the observatory, from Myr by the look of it. The lenscrafters of Myr are without equal.¡±
   Ned frowned. He had little patience for this sort of thing, Catelyn knew. ¡°A lens,¡± he said. ¡°What has that to do with me?¡±
   ¡°I asked the same question,¡± Maester Luwin said. ¡°Clearly there was more to this than the seeming.¡±
   Under the heavy weight of her furs, Catelyn shivered. ¡°A lens is an instrument to help us see.¡±
   ¡°Indeed it is.¡± He fingered the collar of his order; a heavy chain worn tight around the neck beneath his robe, each link forged from a different metal.
   Catelyn could feel dread stirring inside her once again. ¡°What is it that they would have us see more clearly?¡±
   ¡°The very thing I asked myself.¡± Maester Luwin drew a tightly rolled paper out of his sleeve. ¡°I found the true message concealed within a false bottom when I dismantled the box the lens had come in, but it is not for my eyes.¡±
   Ned held out his hand. ¡°Let me have it, then.¡±
   Luwin did not stir. ¡°Pardons, my lord. The message is not for you either. It is marked for the eyes of the Lady Catelyn, and her alone. May I approach?¡±
   Catelyn nodded, not trusting to speak. The maester placed the paper on the table beside the bed. It was sealed with a small blob of blue wax. Luwin bowed and began to retreat.
   ¡°Stay,¡± Ned commanded him. His voice was grave. He looked at Catelyn. ¡°What is it? My lady, you¡¯re shaking.¡±
   ¡°I¡¯m afraid,¡± she admitted. She reached out and took the letter in trembling hands. The furs dropped away from her nakedness, forgotten. In the blue wax was the moon-and-falcon seal of House Arryn. ¡°It¡¯s from Lysa.¡± Catelyn looked at her husband. ¡°It will not make us glad,¡± she told him. ¡°There is grief in this message, Ned. I can feel it.¡±
   Ned frowned, his face darkening. ¡°Open it.¡±
   Catelyn broke the seal.
   Her eyes moved over the words. At first they made no sense to her. Then she remembered. ¡°Lysa took no chances. When we were girls together, we had a private language, she and I.¡±
   ¡°Can you read it?¡±
   ¡°Yes,¡± Catelyn admitted.
   ¡°Then tell us.¡±
   ¡°Perhaps I should withdraw,¡± Maester Luwin said.
   ¡°No,¡± Catelyn said. ¡°We will need your counsel.¡± She threw back the furs and climbed from the bed. The night air was as cold as the grave on her bare skin as she padded across the room.
   Maester Luwin averted his eyes. Even Ned looked shocked. ¡°What are you doing?¡± he asked.
   ¡°Lighting a fire,¡± Catelyn told him. She found a dressing gown and shrugged into it, then knelt over the cold hearth.
   ¡°Maester Luwin...¡± Ned began.
   ¡°Maester Luwin has delivered all my children,¡± Catelyn said. ¡°This is no time for false modesty.¡± She slid the paper in among the kindling and placed the heavier logs on top of it.
   Ned crossed the room, took her by the arm, and pulled her to her feet. He held her there, his face inches from her. ¡°My lady, tell me! What was this message?¡±
   Catelyn stiffened in his grasp. ¡°A warning,¡± she said softly. ¡°If we have the wits to hear.¡±
   His eyes searched her face. ¡°Go on.¡±
   ¡°Lysa says Jon Arryn was murdered.¡±
   His fingers tightened on her arm. ¡°By whom?¡±
   ¡°The Lannisters,¡± she told him. ¡°The queen.¡±
   Ned released his hold on her arm. There were deep red marks on her skin. ¡°Gods,¡± he whispered. His voice was hoarse. ¡°Your sister is sick with grief. She cannot know what she is saying.¡±
   ¡°She knows,¡± Catelyn said. ¡°Lysa is impulsive, yes, but this message was carefully planned, cleverly hidden. She knew it meant death if her letter fell into the wrong hands. To risk so much, she must have had more than mere suspicion.¡± Catelyn looked to her husband. ¡°Now we truly have no choice. You must be Robert¡¯s Hand. You must go south with him and learn the truth.¡±
   She saw at once that Ned had reached a very different conclusion. ¡°The only truths I know are here. The south is a nest of adders I would do better to avoid.¡±
   Luwin plucked at his chain collar where it had chafed the soft skin of his throat. ¡°The Hand of the King has great power, my lord. Power to find the truth of Lord Arryn¡¯s death, to bring his killers to the king¡¯s justice. Power to protect Lady Arryn and her son, if the worst be true.¡±
   Ned glanced helplessly around the bedchamber. Catelyn¡¯s heart went out to him, but she knew she could not take him in her arms just then. First the victory must be won, for her children¡¯s sake. ¡°You say you love Robert like a brother. Would you leave your brother surrounded by Lannisters?¡±
   ¡°The Others take both of you,¡± Ned muttered darkly. He turned away from them and went to the window. She did not speak, nor did the maester. They waited, quiet, while Eddard Stark said a silent farewell to the home he loved. When he turned away from the window at last, his voice was tired and full of melancholy, and moisture glittered faintly in the corners of his eyes. ¡°My father went south once, to answer the summons of a king. He never came home again.¡±
   ¡°A different time,¡± Maester Luwin said. ¡°A different king.¡±
   ¡°Yes,¡± Ned said dully. He seated himself in a chair by the hearth. ¡°Catelyn, you shall stay here in Winterfell.¡±
   His words were like an icy draft through her heart. ¡°No,¡± she said, suddenly afraid. Was this to be her punishment? Never to see his face again, nor to feel his arms around her?
   ¡°Yes,¡± Ned said, in words that would brook no argument. ¡°You must govern the north in my stead, while I run Robert¡¯s errands. There must always be a Stark in Winterfell. Robb is fourteen. Soon enough, he will be a man grown. He must learn to rule, and I will not be here for him. Make him part of your councils. He must be ready when his time comes.¡±
   ¡°Gods will, not for many years,¡± Maester Luwin murmured.
   ¡°Maester Luwin, I trust you as I would my own blood. Give my wife your voice in all things great and small. Teach my son the things he needs to know. Winter is coming.¡±
   Maester Luwin nodded gravely. Then silence fell, until Catelyn found her courage and asked the question whose answer she most dreaded. ¡°What of the other children?¡±
   Ned stood, and took her in his arms, and held her face close to his. ¡°Rickon is very young,¡± he said gently. ¡°He should stay here with you and Robb. The others I would take with me.¡±
   ¡°I could not bear it,¡± Catelyn said, trembling.
   ¡°You must,¡± he said. ¡°Sansa must wed Joffrey, that is clear now, we must give them no grounds to suspect our devotion. And it is past time that Arya learned the ways of a southron court. In a few years she will be of an age to marry too.¡±
   Sansa would shine in the south, Catelyn thought to herself, and the gods knew that Arya needed refinement. Reluctantly, she let go of them in her heart. But not Bran. Never Bran. ¡°Yes,¡± she said, ¡°but please, Ned, for the love you bear me, let Bran remain here at Winterfell. He is only seven.¡±
   ¡°I was eight when my father sent me to foster at the Eyrie,¡± Ned said. ¡°Ser Rodrik tells me there is bad feeling between Robb and Prince Joffrey. That is not healthy. Bran can bridge that distance. He is a sweet boy, quick to laugh, easy to love. Let him grow up with the young princes, let him become their friend as Robert became mine. Our House will be the safer for it.¡±
   He was right; Catelyn knew it. It did not make the pain any easier to bear. She would lose all four of them, then: Ned, and both girls, and her sweet, loving Bran. Only Robb and little Rickon would be left to her. She felt lonely already. Winterfell was such a vast place. ¡°Keep him off the walls, then,¡± she said bravely. ¡°You know how Bran loves to climb.¡±
   Ned kissed the tears from her eyes before they could fall. ¡°Thank you, my lady,¡± he whispered. ¡°This is hard, I know.¡±
   ¡°What of Jon Snow, my lord?¡± Maester Luwin asked.
   Catelyn tensed at the mention of the name. Ned felt the anger in her, and pulled away.
   Many men fathered bastards. Catelyn had grown up with that knowledge. It came as no surprise to her, in the first year of her marriage, to learn that Ned had fathered a child on some girl chance met on campaign. He had a man¡¯s needs, after all, and they had spent that year apart, Ned off at war in the south while she remained safe in her father¡¯s castle at Riverrun. Her thoughts were more of Robb, the infant at her breast, than of the husband she scarcely knew. He was welcome to whatever solace he might find between battles. And if his seed quickened, she expected he would see to the child¡¯s needs.
   He did more than that. The Starks were not like other men. Ned brought his bastard home with him, and called him ¡°son¡± for all the north to see. When the wars were over at last, and Catelyn rode to Winterfell, Jon and his wet nurse had already taken up residence.
   That cut deep. Ned would not speak of the mother, not so much as a word, but a castle has no secrets, and Catelyn heard her maids repeating tales they heard from the lips of her husband¡¯s soldiers. They whispered of Ser Arthur Dayne, the Sword of the Morning, deadliest of the seven knights of Aerys¡¯s Kingsguard, and of how their young lord had slain him in single combat. And they told how afterward Ned had carried Ser Arthur¡¯s sword back to the beautiful young sister who awaited him in a castle called Starfall on the shores of the Summer Sea. The Lady Ashara Dayne, tall and fair, with haunting violet eyes. It had taken her a fortnight to marshal her courage, but finally, in bed one night, Catelyn had asked her husband the truth of it, asked him to his face.
   That was the only time in all their years that Ned had ever frightened her. ¡°Never ask me about Jon,¡± he said, cold as ice. ¡°He is my blood, and that is all you need to know. And now I will learn where you heard that name, my lady.¡± She had pledged to obey; she told him; and from that day on, the whispering had stopped, and Ashara Dayne¡¯s name was never heard in Winterfell again.
   Whoever Jon¡¯s mother had been, Ned must have loved her fiercely, for nothing Catelyn said would persuade him to send the boy away. It was the one thing she could never forgive him. She had come to love her husband with all her heart, but she had never found it in her to love Jon. She might have overlooked a dozen bastards for Ned¡¯s sake, so long as they were out of sight. Jon was never out of sight, and as he grew, he looked more like Ned than any of the trueborn sons she bore him. Somehow that made it worse. ¡°Jon must go,¡± she said now.
   ¡°He and Robb are close,¡± Ned said. ¡°I had hoped?.?.?.?¡±
   ¡°He cannot stay here,¡± Catelyn said, cutting him off. ¡°He is your son, not mine. I will not have him.¡± It was hard, she knew, but no less the truth. Ned would do the boy no kindness by leaving him here at Winterfell.
   The look Ned gave her was anguished. ¡°You know I cannot take him south. There will be no place for him at court. A boy with a bastard¡¯s name?.?.?.?you know what they will say of him. He will be shunned.¡±
   Catelyn armored her heart against the mute appeal in her husband¡¯s eyes. ¡°They say your friend Robert has fathered a dozen bastards himself.¡±
   ¡°And none of them has ever been seen at court!¡± Ned blazed. ¡°The Lannister woman has seen to that. How can you be so damnably cruel, Catelyn? He is only a boy. He...¡±
   His fury was on him. He might have said more, and worse, but Maester Luwin cut in. ¡°Another solution presents itself,¡± he said, his voice quiet. ¡°Your brother Benjen came to me about Jon a few days ago. It seems the boy aspires to take the black.¡±
   Ned looked shocked. ¡°He asked to join the Night¡¯s Watch?¡±
   Catelyn said nothing. Let Ned work it out in his own mind; her voice would not be welcome now. Yet gladly would she have kissed the maester just then. His was the perfect solution. Benjen Stark was a Sworn Brother. Jon would be a son to him, the child he would never have. And in time the boy would take the oath as well. He would father no sons who might someday contest with Catelyn¡¯s own grandchildren for Winterfell.
   Maester Luwin said, ¡°There is great honor in service on the Wall, my lord.¡±
   ¡°And even a bastard may rise high in the Night¡¯s Watch,¡± Ned reflected. Still, his voice was troubled. ¡°Jon is so young. If he asked this when he was a man grown, that would be one thing, but a boy of fourteen?.?.?.?¡±
   ¡°A hard sacrifice,¡± Maester Luwin agreed. ¡°Yet these are hard times, my lord. His road is no crueler than yours or your lady¡¯s.¡±
   Catelyn thought of the three children she must lose. It was not easy keeping silent then.
   Ned turned away from them to gaze out the window, his long face silent and thoughtful. Finally he sighed, and turned back. ¡°Very well,¡± he said to Maester Luwin. ¡°I suppose it is for the best. I will speak to Ben.¡±
   ¡°When shall we tell Jon?¡± the maester asked.
   ¡°When I must. Preparations must be made. It will be a fortnight before we are ready to depart. I would sooner let Jon enjoy these last few days. Summer will end soon enough, and childhood as well. When the time comes, I will tell him myself.¡±
   
   7£®ARYA
   Arya¡¯s stitches were crooked again.
   She frowned down at them with dismay and glanced over to where her sister Sansa sat among the other girls. Sansa¡¯s needlework was exquisite. Everyone said so. ¡°Sansa¡¯s work is as pretty as she is,¡± Septa Mordane told their lady mother once. ¡°She has such fine, delicate hands.¡± When Lady Catelyn had asked about Arya, the septa had sniffed. ¡°Arya has the hands of a blacksmith.¡±
   Arya glanced furtively across the room, worried that Septa Mordane might have read her thoughts, but the septa was paying her no attention today. She was sitting with the Princess Myrcella, all smiles and admiration. It was not often that the septa was privileged to instruct a royal princess in the womanly arts, as she had said when the queen brought Myrcella to join them. Arya thought that Myrcella¡¯s stitches looked a little crooked too, but you would never know it from the way Septa Mordane was cooing.
   She studied her own work again, looking for some way to salvage it, then sighed and put down the needle. She looked glumly at her sister. Sansa was chatting away happily as she worked. Beth Cassel, Ser Rodrik¡¯s little girl, was sitting by her feet, listening to every word she said, and Jeyne Poole was leaning over to whisper something in her ear.
   ¡°What are you talking about?¡± Arya asked suddenly.
   Jeyne gave her a startled look, then giggled. Sansa looked abashed. Beth blushed. No one answered.
   ¡°Tell me,¡± Arya said.
   Jeyne glanced over to make certain that Septa Mordane was not listening. Myrcella said something then, and the septa laughed along with the rest of the ladies.
   ¡°We were talking about the prince,¡± Sansa said, her voice soft as a kiss.
   Arya knew which prince she meant: Jofftey, of course. The tall, handsome one. Sansa got to sit with him at the feast. Arya had to sit with the little fat one. Naturally.
   ¡°Joffrey likes your sister,¡± Jeyne whispered, proud as if she had something to do with it. She was the daughter of Winterfell¡¯s steward and Sansa¡¯s dearest friend. ¡°He told her she was very beautiful.¡±
   ¡°He¡¯s going to marry her,¡± little Beth said dreamily, hugging herself. ¡°Then Sansa will be queen of all the realm.¡±
   Sansa had the grace to blush. She blushed prettily. She did everything prettily, Arya thought with dull resentment. ¡°Beth, you shouldn¡¯t make up stories,¡± Sansa corrected the younger girl, gently stroking her hair to take the harshness out of her words. She looked at Arya. ¡°What did you think of Prince Joff, sister? He¡¯s very gallant, don¡¯t you think?¡±
   ¡°Jon says he looks like a girl,¡± Arya said.
   Sansa sighed as she stitched. ¡°Poor Jon,¡± she said. ¡°He gets jealous because he¡¯s a bastard.¡±
   ¡°He¡¯s our brother,¡± Arya said, much too loudly. Her voice cut through the afternoon quiet of the tower room.
   Septa Mordane raised her eyes. She had a bony face, sharp eyes, and a thin lipless mouth made for frowning. It was frowning now. ¡°What are you talking about, children?¡±
   ¡°Our half brother,¡± Sansa corrected, soft and precise. She smiled for the septa. ¡°Arya and I were remarking on how pleased we were to have the princess with us today,¡± she said.
   Septa Mordane nodded. ¡°Indeed. A great honor for us all.¡± Princess Myrcella smiled uncertainly at the compliment. ¡°Arya, why aren¡¯t you at work?¡± the septa asked. She rose to her feet, starched skirts rustling as she started across the room. ¡°Let me see your stitches.¡±
   Arya wanted to scream. It was just like Sansa to go and attract the septa¡¯s attention. ¡°Here,¡± she said, surrendering up her work.
   The septa examined the fabric. ¡°Arya, Arya, Arya,¡± she said. ¡°This will not do. This will not do at all.¡±
   Everyone was looking at her. It was too much. Sansa was too well bred to smile at her sister¡¯s disgrace, but Jeyne was smirking on her behalf. Even Princess Myrcella looked sorry for her. Arya felt tears filling her eyes. She pushed herself out of her chair and bolted for the door.
   Septa Mordane called after her. ¡°Arya, come back here! Don¡¯t you take another step! Your lady mother will hear of this. In front of our royal princess too! You¡¯ll shame us all!¡±
   Arya stopped at the door and turned back, biting her lip. The tears were running down her cheeks now. She managed a stiff little bow to Myrcella. ¡°By your leave, my lady.¡±
   Myrcella blinked at her and looked to her ladies for guidance. But if she was uncertain, Septa Mordane was not. ¡°Just where do you think you are going, Arya?¡± the septa demanded.
   Arya glared at her. ¡°I have to go shoe a horse,¡± she said sweetly, taking a brief satisfaction in the shock on the septa¡¯s face. Then she whirled and made her exit, running down the steps as fast as her feet would take her.
   It wasn¡¯t fair. Sansa had everything. Sansa was two years older; maybe by the time Arya had been born, there had been nothing left. Often it felt that way. Sansa could sew and dance and sing. She wrote poetry. She knew how to dress. She played the high harp and the bells. Worse, she was beautiful. Sansa had gotten their mother¡¯s fine high cheekbones and the thick auburn hair of the Tullys. Arya took after their lord father. Her hair was a lusterless brown, and her face was long and solemn. Jeyne used to call her Arya Horseface, and neigh whenever she came near. It hurt that the one thing Arya could do better than her sister was ride a horse. Well, that and manage a household. Sansa had never had much of a head for figures. If she did marry Prince Joff, Arya hoped for his sake that he had a good steward.
   Nymeria was waiting for her in the guardroom at the base of the stairs. She bounded to her feet as soon as she caught sight of Arya. Arya grinned. The wolf pup loved her, even if no one else did. They went everywhere together, and Nymeria slept in her room, at the foot of her bed. If Mother had not forbidden it, Arya would gladly have taken the wolf with her to needlework. Let Septa Mordane complain about her stitches then.
   Nymeria nipped eagerly at her hand as Arya untied her. She had yellow eyes. When they caught the sunlight, they gleamed like two golden coins. Arya had named her after the warrior queen of the Rhoyne, who had led her people across the narrow sea. That had been a great scandal too. Sansa, of course, had named her pup ¡°Lady.¡± Arya made a face and hugged the wolfling tight. Nymeria licked her ear, and she giggled.
   By now Septa Mordane would certainly have sent word to her lady mother. If she went to her room, they would find her. Arya did not care to be found. She had a better notion. The boys were at practice in the yard. She wanted to see Robb put gallant Prince Joffrey flat on his back. ¡°Come,¡± she whispered to Nymeria. She got up and ran, the wolf coming hard at her heels.
   There was a window in the covered bridge between the armory and the Great Keep where you had a view of the whole yard. That was where they headed.
   They arrived, flushed and breathless, to find Jon seated on the sill, one leg drawn up languidly to his chin. He was watching the action, so absorbed that he seemed unaware of her approach until his white wolf moved to meet them. Nymeria stalked closer on wary feet. Ghost, already larger than his litter mates, smelled her, gave her ear a careful nip, and settled back down.
   Jon gave her a curious look. ¡°Shouldn¡¯t you be working on your stitches, little sister?¡±
   Arya made a face at him. ¡°I wanted to see them fight.¡±
   He smiled. ¡°Come here, then.¡±
   Arya climbed up on the window and sat beside him, to a chorus of thuds and grunts from the yard below.
   To her disappointment, it was the younger boys drilling. Bran was so heavily padded he looked as though he had belted on a featherbed, and Prince Tommen, who was plump to begin with, seemed positively round. They were huffing and puffing and hitting at each other with padded wooden swords under the watchful eye of old Ser Rodrik Cassel, the master-at-arms, a great stout keg of a man with magnificent white cheek whiskers. A dozen spectators, man and boy, were calling out encouragement, Robb¡¯s voice the loudest among them. She spotted Theon Greyjoy beside him, his black doublet emblazoned with the golden kraken of his House, a look of wry contempt on his face. Both of the combatants were staggering. Arya judged that they had been at it awhile.
   ¡°A shade more exhausting than needlework,¡± Jon observed.
   ¡°A shade more fun than needlework,¡± Arya gave back at him. Jon grinned, reached over, and messed up her hair. Arya flushed. They had always been close. Jon had their father¡¯s face, as she did. They were the only ones. Robb and Sansa and Bran and even little Rickon all took after the Tullys, with easy smiles and fire in their hair. When Arya had been little, she had been afraid that meant that she was a bastard too. It been Jon she had gone to in her fear, and Jon who had reassured her.
   ¡°Why aren¡¯t you down in the yard?¡± Arya asked him.
   He gave her a half smile. ¡°Bastards are not allowed to damage young princes,¡± he said. ¡°Any bruises they take in the practice yard must come from trueborn swords.¡±
   ¡°Oh.¡± Arya felt abashed. She should have realized. For the second time today, Arya reflected that life was not fair.
   She watched her little brother whack at Tommen. ¡°I could do just as good as Bran,¡± she said. ¡°He¡¯s only seven. I¡¯m nine.¡±
   Jon looked her over with all his fourteen-year-old wisdom. ¡°You¡¯re too skinny,¡± he said. He took her arm to feel her muscle. Then he sighed and shook his head. ¡°I doubt you could even lift a longsword, little sister, never mind swing one.¡±
   Arya snatched back her arm and glared at him. Jon messed up her hair again. They watched Bran and Tommen circle each other.
   ¡°You see Prince Joffrey?¡± Jon asked.
   She hadn¡¯t, not at first glance, but when she looked again she found him to the back, under the shade of the high stone wall. He was surrounded by men she did not recognize, young squires in the livery of Lannister and Baratheon, strangers all. There were a few older men among them; knights, she surmised.
   ¡°Look at the arms on his surcoat,¡± Jon suggested.
   Arya looked. An ornate shield had been embroidered on the prince¡¯s padded surcoat. No doubt the needlework was exquisite. The arms were divided down the middle; on one side was the crowned stag of the royal House, on the other the lion of Lannister.
   ¡°The Lannisters are proud,¡± Jon observed. ¡°You¡¯d think the royal sigil would be sufficient, but no. He makes his mother¡¯s House equal in honor to the king¡¯s.¡±
   ¡°The woman is important too!¡± Arya protested.
   Jon chuckled. ¡°Perhaps you should do the same thing, little sister. Wed Tully to Stark in your arms.¡±
   ¡°A wolf with a fish in its mouth?¡± It made her laugh. ¡°That would look silly. Besides, if a girl can¡¯t fight, why should she have a coat of arms?¡±
   Jon shrugged. ¡°Girls get the arms but not the swords. Bastards get the swords but not the arms. I did not make the rules, little sister.¡±
   There was a shout from the courtyard below. Prince Tommen was rolling in the dust, trying to get up and failing. All the padding made him look like a turtle on its back. Bran was standing over him with upraised wooden sword, ready to whack him again once he regained his feet. The men began to laugh.
   ¡°Enough!¡± Ser Rodrik called out. He gave the prince a hand and yanked him back to his feet. ¡°Well fought. Lew, Donnis, help them out of their armor.¡± He looked around. ¡°Prince Joffrey, Robb, will you go another round?¡±
   Robb, already sweaty from a previous bout, moved forward eagerly. ¡°Gladly.¡±
   Joffrey moved into the sunlight in response to Rodrik¡¯s summons. His hair shone like spun gold. He looked bored. ¡°This is a game for children, Ser Rodrik.¡±
   Theon Greyjoy gave a sudden bark of laughter. ¡°You are children,¡± he said derisively.
   ¡°Robb may be a child,¡± Joffrey said. ¡°I am a prince. And I grow tired of swatting at Starks with a play sword.¡±
   ¡°You got more swats than you gave, Joff,¡± Robb said. ¡°Are you afraid?¡±
   Prince Joffrey looked at him. ¡°Oh, terrified,¡± he said. ¡°You¡¯re so much older.¡± Some of the Lannister men laughed.
   Jon looked down on the scene with a frown. ¡°Joffrey is truly a little shit,¡± he told Arya.
   Ser Rodrik tugged thoughtfully at his white whiskers. ¡°What are you suggesting?¡± he asked the prince.
   ¡°Live steel.¡±
   ¡°Done,¡± Robb shot back. ¡°You¡¯ll be sorry!¡±
   The master-at-arms put a hand on Robb¡¯s shoulder to quiet him. ¡°Live steel is too dangerous. I will permit you tourney swords, with blunted edges.¡±
   Joffrey said nothing, but a man strange to Arya, a tall knight with black hair and burn scars on his face, pushed forward in front of the prince. ¡°This is your prince. Who are you to tell him he may not have an edge on his sword, ser?¡±
   ¡°Master-at-arms of Winterfell, Clegane, and you would do well not to forget it.¡±
   ¡°Are you training women here?¡± the burned man wanted to know. He was muscled like a bull.
   ¡°I am training knights,¡± Ser Rodrik said pointedly. ¡°They will have steel when they are ready. When they are of an age.¡±
   The burned man looked at Robb. ¡°How old are you, boy?¡±
   ¡°Fourteen,¡± Robb said.
   ¡°I killed a man at twelve. You can be sure it was not with a blunt sword.¡±
   Arya could see Robb bristle. His pride was wounded. He turned on Ser Rodrik. ¡°Let me do it. I can beat him.¡±
   ¡°Beat him with a tourney blade, then,¡± Ser Rodrik said.
   Joffrey shrugged. ¡°Come and see me when you¡¯re older, Stark. If you¡¯re not too old.¡± There was laughter from the Lannister men.
   Robb¡¯s curses rang through the yard. Arya covered her mouth in shock. Theon Greyjoy seized Robb¡¯s arm to keep him away from the prince. Ser Rodrik tugged at his whiskers in dismay.
   Joffrey feigned a yawn and turned to his younger brother. ¡°Come, Tommen,¡± he said. ¡°The hour of play is done. Leave the children to their frolics.¡±
   That brought more laughter from the Lannisters, more curses from Robb. Ser Rodrik¡¯s face was beet-red with fury under the white of his whiskers. Theon kept Robb locked in an iron grip until the princes and their party were safely away.
   Jon watched them leave, and Arya watched Jon. His face had grown as still as the pool at the heart of the godswood. Finally he climbed down off the window. ¡°The show is done,¡± he said. He bent to scratch Ghost behind the ears. The white wolf rose and rubbed against him. ¡°You had best run back to your room, little sister. Septa Mordane will surely be lurking. The longer you hide, the sterner the penance. You¡¯ll be sewing all through winter. When the spring thaw comes, they will find your body with a needle still locked tight between your frozen fingers.¡±
   Arya didn¡¯t think it was funny. ¡°I hate needlework!¡± she said with passion. ¡°It¡¯s not fair!¡±
   ¡°Nothing is fair,¡± Jon said. He messed up her hair again and walked away from her, Ghost moving silently beside him. Nymeria started to follow too, then stopped and came back when she saw that Arya was not coming.
   Reluctantly she turned in the other direction.
   It was worse than Jon had thought. It wasn¡¯t Septa Mordane waiting in her room. It was Septa Mordane and her mother.
   
   8£®BRAN
   The hunt left at dawn. The king wanted wild boar at the feast tonight. Prince Joffrey rode with his father, so Robb had been allowed to join the hunters as well. Uncle Benjen, Jory, Theon Greyjoy, Ser Rodrik, and even the queen¡¯s funny little brother had all ridden out with them. It was the last hunt, after all. On the morrow they left for the south.
   Bran had been left behind with Jon and the girls and Rickon. But Rickon was only a baby and the girls were only girls and Jon and his wolf were nowhere to be found. Bran did not look for him very hard. He thought Jon was angry at him. Jon seemed to be angry at everyone these days. Bran did not know why. He was going with Uncle Ben to the Wall, to join the Night¡¯s Watch. That was almost as good as going south with the king. Robb was the one they were leaving behind, not Jon.
   For days, Bran could scarcely wait to be off. He was going to ride the kingsroad on a horse of his own, not a pony but a real horse. His father would be the Hand of the King, and they were going to live in the red castle at King¡¯s Landing, the castle the Dragonlords had built. Old Nan said there were ghosts there, and dungeons where terrible things had been done, and dragon heads on the walls. It gave Bran a shiver just to think of it, but he was not afraid. How could he be afraid? His father would be with him, and the king with all his knights and sworn swords.
   Bran was going to be a knight himself someday, one of the Kingsguard. Old Nan said they were the finest swords in all the realm. There were only seven of them, and they wore white armor and had no wives or children, but lived only to serve the king. Bran knew all the stories. Their names were like music to him. Serwyn of the Mirror Shield. Ser Ryam Redwyne. Prince Aemon the Dragonknight. The twins Ser Erryk and Ser Arryk, who had died on one another¡¯s swords hundreds of years ago, when brother fought sister in the war the singers called the Dance of the Dragons. The White Bull, Gerold Hightower. Ser Arthur Dayne, the Sword of the Morning. Barristan the Bold.
   Two of the Kingsguard had come north with King Robert. Bran had watched them with fascination, never quite daring to speak to them. Ser Boros was a bald man with a jowly face, and Ser Meryn had droopy eyes and a beard the color of rust. Ser Jaime Lannister looked more like the knights in the stories, and he was of the Kingsguard too, but Robb said he had killed the old mad king and shouldn¡¯t count anymore. The greatest living knight was Ser Barristan Selmy, Barristan the Bold, the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard. Father had promised that they would meet Ser Barristan when they reached King¡¯s Landing, and Bran had been marking the days on his wall, eager to depart, to see a world he had only dreamed of and begin a life he could scarcely imagine.
   Yet now that the last day was at hand, suddenly Bran felt lost. Winterfell had been the only home he had ever known. His father had told him that he ought to say his farewells today, and he had tried. After the hunt had ridden out, he wandered through the castle with his wolf at his side, intending to visit the ones who would be left behind, Old Nan and Gage the cook, Mikken in his smithy, Hodor the stableboy who smiled so much and took care of his pony and never said anything but ¡°Hodor,¡± the man in the glass gardens who gave him a blackberry when he came to visit?.?.?.?
   But it was no good. He had gone to the stable first, and seen his pony there in its stall, except it wasn¡¯t his pony anymore, he was getting a real horse and leaving the pony behind, and all of a sudden Bran just wanted to sit down and cry. He turned and ran off before Hodor and the other stableboys could see the tears in his eyes. That was the end of his farewells. Instead Bran spent the morning alone in the godswood, trying to teach his wolf to fetch a stick, and failing. The wolfling was smarter than any of the hounds in his father¡¯s kennel and Bran would have sworn he understood every word that was said to him, but he showed very little interest in chasing sticks.
   He was still trying to decide on a name. Robb was calling his Grey Wind, because he ran so fast. Sansa had named hers Lady, and Arya named hers after some old witch queen in the songs, and little Rickon called his Shaggydog, which Bran thought was a pretty stupid name for a direwolf. Jon¡¯s wolf, the white one, was Ghost. Bran wished he had thought of that first, even though his wolf wasn¡¯t white. He had tried a hundred names in the last fortnight, but none of them sounded right.
   Finally he got tired of the stick game and decided to go climbing. He hadn¡¯t been up to the broken tower for weeks with everything that had happened, and this might be his last chance.
   He raced across the godswood, taking the long way around to avoid the pool where the heart tree grew. The heart tree had always frightened him; trees ought not have eyes, Bran thought, or leaves that looked like hands. His wolf came sprinting at his heels. ¡°You stay here,¡± he told him at the base of the sentinel tree near the armory wall. ¡°Lie down. That¡¯s right. Now stay...¡±
   The wolf did as he was told. Bran scratched him behind the ears, then turned away, jumped, grabbed a low branch, and pulled himself up. He was halfway up the tree, moving easily from limb to limb, when the wolf got to his feet and began to howl.
   Bran looked back down. His wolf fell silent, staring up at him through slitted yellow eyes. A strange chill went through him. He began to climb again. Once more the wolf howled. ¡°Quiet,¡± he yelled. ¡°Sit down. Stay. You¡¯re worse than Mother.¡± The howling chased him all the way up the tree, until finally he jumped off onto the armory roof and out of sight.
   The rooftops of Winterfell were Bran¡¯s second home. His mother often said that Bran could climb before he could walk. Bran could not remember when he first learned to walk, but he could not remember when he started to climb either, so he supposed it must be true.
   To a boy, Winterfell was a grey stone labyrinth of walls and towers and courtyards and tunnels spreading out in all directions. In the older parts of the castle, the halls slanted up and down so that you couldn¡¯t even be sure what floor you were on. The place had grown over the centuries like some monstrous stone tree, Maester Luwin told him once, and its branches were gnarled and thick and twisted, its roots sunk deep into the earth.
   When he got out from under it and scrambled up near the sky, Bran could see all of Winterfell in a glance. He liked the way it looked, spread out beneath him, only birds wheeling over his head while all the life of the castle went on below. Bran could perch for hours among the shapeless, rain-worn gargoyles that brooded over the First Keep, watching it all: the men drilling with wood and steel in the yard, the cooks tending their vegetables in the glass garden, restless dogs running back and forth in the kennels, the silence of the godswood, the girls gossiping beside the washing well. It made him feel like he was lord of the castle, in a way even Robb would never know.
   It taught him Winterfell¡¯s secrets too. The builders had not even leveled the earth; there were hills and valleys behind the walls of Winterfell. There was a covered bridge that went from the fourth floor of the bell tower across to the second floor of the rookery. Bran knew about that. And he knew you could get inside the inner wall by the south gate, climb three floors and run all the way around Winterfell through a narrow tunnel in the stone, and then come out on ground level at the north gate, with a hundred feet of wall looming over you. Even Maester Luwin didn¡¯t know that, Bran was convinced.
   His mother was terrified that one day Bran would slip off a wall and kill himself. He told her that he wouldn¡¯t, but she never believed him. Once she made him promise that he would stay on the ground. He had managed to keep that promise for almost a fortnight, miserable every day, until one night he had gone out the window of his bedroom when his brothers were fast asleep.
   He confessed his crime the next day in a fit of guilt. Lord Eddard ordered him to the godswood to cleanse himself. Guards were posted to see that Bran remained there alone all night to reflect on his disobedience. The next morning Bran was nowhere to be seen. They finally found him fast asleep in the upper branches of the tallest sentinel in the grove.
   As angry as he was, his father could not help but laugh. ¡°You¡¯re not my son,¡± he told Bran when they fetched him down, ¡°you¡¯re a squirrel. So be it. If you must climb, then climb, but try not to let your mother see you.¡±
   Bran did his best, although he did not think he ever really fooled her. Since his father would not forbid it, she turned to others. Old Nan told him a story about a bad little boy who climbed too high and was struck down by lightning, and how afterward the crows came to peck out his eyes. Bran was not impressed. There were crows¡¯ nests atop the broken tower, where no one ever went but him, and sometimes he filled his pockets with corn before he climbed up there and the crows ate it right out of his hand. None of them had ever shown the slightest bit of interest in pecking out his eyes.
   Later, Maester Luwin built a little pottery boy and dressed him in Bran¡¯s clothes and flung him off the wall into the yard below, to demonstrate what would happen to Bran if he fell. That had been fun, but afterward Bran just looked at the maester and said, ¡°I¡¯m not made of clay. And anyhow, I never fall.¡±
   Then for a while the guards would chase him whenever they saw him on the roofs, and try to haul him down. That was the best time of all. It was like playing a game with his brothers, except that Bran always won. None of the guards could climb half so well as Bran, not even Jory. Most of the time they never saw him anyway. People never looked up. That was another thing he liked about climbing; it was almost like being invisible.
   He liked how it felt too, pulling himself up a wall stone by stone, fingers and toes digging hard into the small crevices between. He always took off his boots and went barefoot when he climbed; it made him feel as if he had four hands instead of two. He liked the deep, sweet ache it left in the muscles afterward. He liked the way the air tasted way up high, sweet and cold as a winter peach. He liked the birds: the crows in the broken tower, the tiny little sparrows that nested in cracks between the stones, the ancient owl that slept in the dusty loft above the old armory. Bran knew them all.
   Most of all, he liked going places that no one else could go, and seeing the grey sprawl of Winterfell in a way that no one else ever saw it. It made the whole castle Bran¡¯s secret place.
   His favorite haunt was the broken tower. Once it had been a watchtower, the tallest in Winterfell. A long time ago, a hundred years before even his father had been born, a lightning strike had set it afire. The top third of the structure had collapsed inward, and the tower had never been rebuilt. Sometimes his father sent ratters into the base of the tower, to clean out the nests they always found among the jumble of fallen stones and charred and rotten beams. But no one ever got up to the jagged top of the structure now except for Bran and the crows.
   He knew two ways to get there. You could climb straight up the side of the tower itself, but the stones were loose, the mortar that held them together long gone to ash, and Bran never liked to put his full weight on them.
   The best way was to start from the godswood, shinny up the tall sentinel, and cross over the armory and the guards hall, leaping roof to roof, barefoot so the guards wouldn¡¯t hear you overhead. That brought you up to the blind side of the First Keep, the oldest part of the castle, a squat round fortress that was taller than it looked. Only rats and spiders lived there now but the old stones still made for good climbing. You could go straight up to where the gargoyles leaned out blindly over empty space, and swing from gargoyle to gargoyle, hand over hand, around to the north side. From there, if you really stretched, you could reach out and pull yourself over to the broken tower where it leaned close. The last part was the scramble up the blackened stones to the eyrie, no more than ten feet, and then the crows would come round to see if you¡¯d brought any corn.
   Bran was moving from gargoyle to gargoyle with the ease of long practice when he heard the voices. He was so startled he almost lost his grip. The First Keep had been empty all his life.
   ¡°I do not like it,¡± a woman was saying. There was a row of windows beneath him, and the voice was drifting out of the last window on this side. ¡°You should be the Hand.¡±
   ¡°Gods forbid,¡± a man¡¯s voice replied lazily. ¡°It¡¯s not an honor I¡¯d want. There¡¯s far too much work involved.¡±
   Bran hung, listening, suddenly afraid to go on. They might glimpse his feet if he tried to swing by.
   ¡°Don¡¯t you see the danger this puts us in?¡± the woman said. ¡°Robert loves the man like a brother.¡±
   ¡°Robert can barely stomach his brothers. Not that I blame him. Stannis would be enough to give anyone indigestion.¡±
   ¡°Don¡¯t play the fool. Stannis and Renly are one thing, and Eddard Stark is quite another. Robert will listen to Stark. Damn them both. I should have insisted that he name you, but I was certain Stark would refuse him.¡±
   ¡°We ought to count ourselves fortunate,¡± the man said. ¡°The king might as easily have named one of his brothers, or even Littlefinger, gods help us. Give me honorable enemies rather than ambitious ones, and I¡¯ll sleep more easily by night.¡±
   They were talking about Father, Bran realized. He wanted to hear more. A few more feet?.?.?.?but they would see him if he swung out in front of the window.
   ¡°We will have to watch him carefully,¡± the woman said.
   ¡°I would sooner watch you,¡± the man said. He sounded bored. ¡°Come back here.¡±
   ¡°Lord Eddard has never taken any interest in anything that happened south of the Neck,¡± the woman said. ¡°Never. I tell you, he means to move against us. Why else would he leave the seat of his power?¡±
   ¡°A hundred reasons. Duty. Honor. He yearns to write his name large across the book of history, to get away from his wife, or both. Perhaps he just wants to be warm for once in his life.¡±
   ¡°His wife is Lady Arryn¡¯s sister. It¡¯s a wonder Lysa was not here to greet us with her accusations.¡±
   Bran looked down. There was a narrow ledge beneath the window, only a few inches wide. He tried to lower himself toward it. Too far. He would never reach.
   ¡°You fret too much. Lysa Arryn is a frightened cow.¡±
   ¡°That frightened cow shared Jon Arryn¡¯s bed.¡±
   ¡°If she knew anything, she would have gone to Robert before she fled King¡¯s Landing.¡±
   ¡°When he had already agreed to foster that weakling son of hers at Casterly Rock? I think not. She knew the boy¡¯s life would be hostage to her silence. She may grow bolder now that he¡¯s safe atop the Eyrie.¡±
   ¡°Mothers.¡± The man made the word sound like a curse. ¡°I think birthing does something to your minds. You are all mad.¡± He laughed. It was a bitter sound. ¡°Let Lady Arryn grow as bold as she likes. Whatever she knows, whatever she thinks she knows, she has no proof.¡± He paused a moment. ¡°Or does she?¡±
   ¡°Do you think the king will require proof?¡± the woman said. ¡°I tell you, he loves me not.¡±
   ¡°And whose fault is that, sweet sister?¡±
   Bran studied the ledge. He could drop down. It was too narrow to land on, but if he could catch hold as he fell past, pull himself up?.?.?.?except that might make a noise, draw them to the window. He was not sure what he was hearing, but he knew it was not meant for his ears.
   ¡°You are as blind as Robert,¡± the woman was saying.
   ¡°If you mean I see the same thing, yes,¡± the man said. ¡°I see a man who would sooner die than betray his king.¡±
   ¡°He betrayed one already, or have you forgotten?¡± the woman said. ¡°Oh, I don¡¯t deny he¡¯s loyal to Robert, that¡¯s obvious. What happens when Robert dies and Joff takes the throne? And the sooner that comes to pass, the safer we¡¯ll all be. My husband grows more restless every day. Having Stark beside him will only make him worse. He¡¯s still in love with the sister, the insipid little dead sixteen-year-old. How long till he decides to put me aside for some new Lyanna?¡±
   Bran was suddenly very frightened. He wanted nothing so much as to go back the way he had come, to find his brothers. Only what would he tell them? He had to get closer, Bran realized. He had to see who was talking.
   The man sighed. ¡°You should think less about the future and more about the pleasures at hand.¡±
   ¡°Stop that!¡± the woman said. Bran heard the sudden slap of flesh on flesh, then the man¡¯s laughter.
   Bran pulled himself up, climbed over the gargoyle, crawled out onto the roof. This was the easy way. He moved across the roof to the next gargoyle, right above the window of the room where they were talking.
   ¡°All this talk is getting very tiresome, sister,¡± the man said. ¡°Come here and be quiet.¡±
   Bran sat astride the gargoyle, tightened his legs around it, and swung himself around, upside down. He hung by his legs and slowly stretched his head down toward the window. The world looked strange upside down. A courtyard swam dizzily below him, its stones still wet with melted snow.
   Bran looked in the window.
   Inside the room, a man and a woman were wrestling. They were both naked. Bran could not tell who they were. The man¡¯s back was to him, and his body screened the woman from view as he pushed her up against a wall.
   There were soft, wet sounds. Bran realized they were kissing. He watched, wide-eyed and frightened, his breath tight in his throat. The man had a hand down between her legs, and he must have been hurting her there, because the woman started to moan, low in her throat. ¡°Stop it,¡± she said, ¡°stop it, stop it. Oh, please?.?.?.?¡± But her voice was low and weak, and she did not push him away. Her hands buried themselves in his hair, his tangled golden hair, and pulled his face down to her breast.
   Bran saw her face. Her eyes were closed and her mouth was open, moaning. Her golden hair swung from side to side as her head moved back and forth, but still he recognized the queen.
   He must have made a noise. Suddenly her eyes opened, and she was staring right at him. She screamed.
   Everything happened at once then. ¡® The woman pushed the man away wildly, shouting and pointing. Bran tried to pull himself up, bending double as he reached for the gargoyle. He was in too much of a hurry. His hand scraped uselessly across smooth stone, and in his panic his legs slipped, and suddenly he was failing. There was an instant of vertigo, a sickening lurch as the window flashed past. He shot out a hand, grabbed for the ledge, lost it, caught it again with his other hand. He swung against the building, hard. The impact took the breath out of him. Bran dangled, one-handed, panting.
   Faces appeared in the window above him.
   The queen. And now Bran recognized the man beside her. They looked as much alike as reflections in a mirror.
   ¡°He saw us,¡± the woman said shrilly.
   ¡°So he did,¡± the man said.
   Bran¡¯s fingers started to slip. He grabbed the ledge with his other hand. Fingernails dug into unyielding stone. The man reached down. ¡°Take my hand,¡± he said. ¡°Before you fall.¡±
   Bran seized his arm and held on tight with all his strength. The man yanked him up to the ledge. ¡°What are you doing?¡± the woman demanded.
   The man ignored her. He was very strong. He stood Bran up on the sill. ¡°How old are you, boy?¡±
   ¡°Seven,¡± Bran said, shaking with relief. His fingers had dug deep gouges in the man¡¯s forearm. He let go sheepishly.
   The man looked over at the woman. ¡°The things I do for love,¡± he said with loathing. He gave Bran a shove.
   Screaming, Bran went backward out the window into empty air. There was nothing to grab on to. The courtyard rushed up to meet him.
   Somewhere off in the distance, a wolf was howling. Crows circled the broken tower, waiting for corn.
   
   9£®TYRION
   Somewhere in the great stone maze of Winterfell, a wolf howled. The sound hung over the castle like a flag of mourning.
   Tyrion Lannister looked up from his books and shivered, though the library was snug and warm. Something about the howling of a wolf took a man right out of his here and now and left him in a dark forest of the mind, running naked before the pack.
   When the direwolf howled again, Tyrion shut the heavy leatherbound cover on the book he was reading, a hundred-year-old discourse on the changing of the seasons by a long-dead maester. He covered a yawn with the back of his hand. His reading lamp was flickering, its oil all but gone, as dawn light leaked through the high windows. He had been at it all night, but that was nothing new. Tyrion Lannister was not much a one for sleeping.
   His legs were stiff and sore as he eased down off the bench. He massaged some life back into them and limped heavily to the table where the septon was snoring softly, his head pillowed on an open book in front of him. Tyrion glanced at the title. A life of the Grand Maester Aethelmure, no wonder. ¡°Chayle,¡± he said softly. The young man jerked up, blinking, confused, the crystal of his order swinging wildly on its silver chain. ¡°I¡¯m off to break my fast. See that you return the books to the shelves. Be gentle with the Valyrian scrolls, the parchment is very dry. Ayrmidon¡¯s Engines of War is quite rare, and yours is the only complete copy I¡¯ve ever seen.¡± Chayle gaped at him, still half-asleep. Patiently, Tyrion repeated his instructions, then clapped the septon on the shoulder and left him to his tasks.
   Outside, Tyrion swallowed a lungful of the cold morning air and began his laborious descent of the steep stone steps that corkscrewed around the exterior of the library tower. It was slow going; the steps were cut high and narrow, while his legs were short and twisted. The rising sun had not yet cleared the walls of Winterfell, but the men were already hard at it in the yard below. Sandor Clegane¡¯s rasping voice drifted up to him. ¡°The boy is a long time dying. I wish he would be quicker about it.¡±
   Tyrion glanced down and saw the Hound standing with young Joffrey as squires swarmed around them. ¡°At least he dies quietly,¡± the prince replied. ¡°It¡¯s the wolf that makes the noise. I could scarce sleep last night.¡±
   Clegane cast a long shadow across the hard-packed earth as his squire lowered the black helm over his head. ¡°I could silence the creature, if it please you,¡± he said through his open visor. His boy placed a longsword in his hand. He tested the weight of it, slicing at the cold morning air. Behind him, the yard rang to the clangor of steel on steel.
   The notion seemed to delight the prince. ¡°Send a dog to kill a dog!¡± he exclaimed. ¡°Winterfell is so infested with wolves, the Starks would never miss one.¡±
   Tyrion hopped off the last step onto the yard. ¡°I beg to differ, nephew,¡± he said. ¡°The Starks can count past six. Unlike some princes I might name.¡±
   Joffrey had the grace at least to blush.
   ¡°A voice from nowhere,¡± Sandor said. He peered through his helm, looking this way and that. ¡°Spirits of the air!¡±
   The prince laughed, as he always laughed when his bodyguard did this mummer¡¯s farce. Tyrion was used to it. ¡°Down here.¡±
   The tall man peered down at the ground, and pretended to notice him. ¡°The little lord Tyrion,¡± he said. ¡°My pardons. I did not see you standing there.¡±
   ¡°I am in no mood for your insolence today.¡± Tyrion turned to his nephew. ¡°Joffrey, it is past time you called on Lord Eddard and his lady, to offer them your comfort.¡±
   Joffrey looked as petulant as only a boy prince can look. ¡°What good will my comfort do them?¡±
   ¡°None,¡± Tyrion said. ¡°Yet it is expected of you. Your absence has been noted.¡±
   ¡°The Stark boy is nothing to me,¡± Joffrey said. ¡°I cannot abide the wailing of women.¡±
   Tyrion Lannister reached up and slapped his nephew hard across the face. The boy¡¯s cheek began to redden.
   ¡°One word,¡± Tyrion said, ¡°and I will hit you again.¡±
   ¡°I¡¯m going to tell Mother!¡± Joffrey exclaimed.
   Tyrion hit him again. Now both cheeks flamed.
   ¡°You tell your mother,¡± Tyrion told him. ¡°But first you get yourself to Lord and Lady Stark, and you fall to your knees in front of them, and you tell them how very sorry you are, and that you are at their service if there is the slightest thing you can do for them or theirs in this desperate hour, and that all your prayers go with them. Do you understand? Do you?¡±
   The boy looked as though he was going to cry. Instead, he managed a weak nod. Then he turned and fled headlong from the yard, holding his cheek. Tyrion watched him run.
   A shadow fell across his face. He turned to find Clegane looming overhead like a cliff. His soot-dark armor seemed to blot out the sun. He had lowered the visor on his helm. It was fashioned in the likeness of a snarling black hound, fearsome to behold, but Tyrion had always thought it a great improvement over Clegane¡¯s hideously burned face.
   ¡°The prince will remember that, little lord,¡± the Hound warned him. The helm turned his laugh into a hollow rumble.
   ¡°I pray he does,¡± Tyrion Lannister replied. ¡°If he forgets, be a good dog and remind him.¡± He glanced around the courtyard. ¡°Do you know where I might find my brother?¡±
   ¡°Breaking fast with the queen.¡±
   ¡°Ah,¡± Tyrion said. He gave Sandor Clegane a perfunctory nod and walked away as briskly as his stunted legs would carry him, whistling. He pitied the first knight to try the Hound today. The man did have a temper.
   A cold, cheerless meal had been laid out in the morning room of the Guest House. Jaime sat at table with Cersei and the children, talking in low, hushed voices.
   ¡°Is Robert still abed?¡± Tyrion asked as he seated himself, uninvited, at the table.
   His sister peered at him with the same expression of faint distaste she had worn since the day he was born. ¡°The king has not slept at all,¡± she told him. ¡°He is with Lord Eddard. He has taken their sorrow deeply to heart.¡±
   ¡°He has a large heart, our Robert,¡± Jaime said with a lazy smile. There was very little that Jaime took seriously. Tyrion knew that about his brother, and forgave it. During all the terrible long years of his childhood, only Jaime had ever shown him the smallest measure of affection or respect, and for that Tyrion was willing to forgive him most anything.
   A servant approached. ¡°Bread,¡± Tyrion told him, ¡°and two of those little fish, and a mug of that good dark beer to wash them down. Oh, and some bacon. Burn it until it turns black.¡± The man bowed and moved off. Tyrion turned back to his siblings. Twins, male and female. They looked very much the part this morning. Both had chosen a deep green that matched their eyes. Their blond curls were all a fashionable tumble, and gold ornaments shone at wrists and fingers and throats.
   Tyrion wondered what it would be like to have a twin, and decided that he would rather not know. Bad enough to face himself in a looking glass every day. Another him was a thought too dreadful to contemplate.
   Prince Tommen spoke up. ¡°Do you have news of Bran, Uncle?¡±
   ¡°I stopped by the sickroom last night,¡± Tyrion announced. ¡°There was no change. The maester thought that a hopeful sign.¡±
   ¡°I don¡¯t want Brandon to die,¡± Tommen said timorously. He was a sweet boy. Not like his brother, but then Jaime and Tyrion were somewhat less than peas in a pod themselves.
   ¡°Lord Eddard had a brother named Brandon as well,¡± Jaime mused. ¡°One of the hostages murdered by Targaryen. It seems to be an unlucky name.¡±
   ¡°Oh, not so unlucky as all that, surely,¡± Tyrion said. The servant brought his plate. He ripped off a chunk of black bread.
   Cersei was studying him warily. ¡°What do you mean?¡±
   Tyrion gave her a crooked smile. ¡°Why, only that Tommen may get his wish. The maester thinks the boy may yet live.¡± He took a sip of beer.
   Myrcella gave a happy gasp, and Tommen smiled nervously, but it was not the children Tyrion was watching. The glance that passed between Jaime and Cersei lasted no more than a second, but he did not miss it. Then his sister dropped her gaze to the table. ¡°That is no mercy. These northern gods are cruel to let the child linger in such pain.¡±
   ¡°What were the maester¡¯s words?¡± Jaime asked.
   The bacon crunched when he bit into it. Tyrion chewed thoughtfully for a moment and said, ¡°He thinks that if the boy were going to die, he would have done so already. It has been four days with no change.¡±
   ¡°Will Bran get better, Uncle?¡± little Myrcella asked. She had all of her mother¡¯s beauty, and none of her nature.
   ¡°His back is broken, little one,¡± Tyrion told her. ¡°The fall shattered his legs as well. They keep him alive with honey and water, or he would starve to death. Perhaps, if he wakes, he will be able to eat real food, but he will never walk again.¡±
   ¡°If he wakes,¡± Cersei repeated. ¡°Is that likely?¡±
   ¡°The gods alone know,¡± Tyrion told her. ¡°The maester only hopes.¡± He chewed some more bread. ¡°I would swear that wolf of his is keeping the boy alive. The creature is outside his window day and night, howling. Every time they chase it away, it returns. The maester said they closed the window once, to shut out the noise, and Bran seemed to weaken. When they opened it again, his heart beat stronger.¡±
   The queen shuddered. ¡°There is something unnatural about those animals,¡± she said. ¡°They are dangerous. I will not have any of them coming south with us.¡±
   Jaime said, ¡°You¡¯ll have a hard time stopping them, sister. They follow those girls everywhere.¡±
   Tyrion started on his fish. ¡°Are you leaving soon, then?¡±
   ¡°Not near soon enough,¡± Cersei said. Then she frowned. ¡°Are we leaving?¡± she echoed. ¡°What about you? Gods, don¡¯t tell me you are staying here?¡±
   Tyrion shrugged. ¡°Benjen Stark is returning to the Night¡¯s Watch with his brother¡¯s bastard. I have a mind to go with them and see this Wall we have all heard so much of.¡±
   Jaime smiled. ¡°I hope you¡¯re not thinking of taking the black on us, sweet brother.¡±
   Tyrion laughed. ¡°What, me, celibate? The whores would go begging from Dorne to Casterly Rock. No, I just want to stand on top of the Wall and piss off the edge of the world.¡±
   Cersei stood abruptly. ¡°The children don¡¯t need to hear this filth. Tommen, Myrcella, come.¡± She strode briskly from the morning room, her train and her pups trailing behind her.
   Jaime Lannister regarded his brother thoughtfully with those cool green eyes. ¡°Stark will never consent to leave Winterfell with his son lingering in the shadow of death.¡±
   ¡°He will if Robert commands it,¡± Tyrion said. ¡°And Robert will command it. There is nothing Lord Eddard can do for the boy in any case.¡±
   ¡°He could end his torment,¡± Jaime said. ¡°I would, if it were my son. It would be a mercy.¡±
   ¡°I advise against putting that suggestion to Lord Eddard, sweet brother,¡± Tyrion said. ¡°He would not take it kindly.¡±
   ¡°Even if the boy does live, he will be a cripple. Worse than a cripple. A grotesque. Give me a good clean death.¡±
   Tyrion replied with a shrug that accentuated the twist of his shoulders. ¡°Speaking for the grotesques,¡± he said, ¡°I beg to differ. Death is so terribly final, while life is full of possibilities.¡±
   Jaime smiled. ¡°You are a perverse little imp, aren¡¯t you?¡±
   ¡°Oh, yes,¡± Tyrion admitted. ¡°I hope the boy does wake. I would be most interested to hear what he might have to say.¡±
   His brother¡¯s smile curdled like sour milk. ¡°Tyrion, my sweet brother,¡± he said darkly, ¡°there are times when you give me cause to wonder whose side you are on.¡±
   Tyrion¡¯s mouth was full of bread and fish. He took a swallow of strong black beer to wash it all down, and grinned up wolfishly at Jaime, ¡°Why, Jaime, my sweet brother,¡± he said, ¡°you wound me. You know how much I love my family.¡±
   
   10£®JON
   Jon climbed the steps slowly, trying not to think that this might be the last time ever. Ghost padded silently beside him. Outside, snow swirled through the castle gates, and the yard was all noise and chaos, but inside the thick stone walls it was still warm and quiet. Too quiet for Jon¡¯s liking.
   He reached the landing and stood for a long moment, afraid. Ghost nuzzled at his hand. He took courage from that. He straightened, and entered the room.
   Lady Stark was there beside his bed. She had been there, day and night, for close on a fortnight. Not for a moment had she left Bran¡¯s side. She had her meals brought to her there, and chamber pots as well, and a small hard bed to sleep on, though it was said she had scarcely slept at all. She fed him herself, the honey and water and herb mixture that sustained life. Not once did she leave the room. So Jon had stayed away.
   But now there was no more time.
   He stood in the door for a moment, afraid to speak, afraid to come closer. The window was open. Below, a wolf howled. Ghost heard and lifted his head.
   Lady Stark looked over. For a moment she did not seem to recognize him. Finally she blinked. ¡°What are you doing here?¡± she asked in a voice strangely flat and emotionless.
   ¡°I came to see Bran,¡± Jon said. ¡°To say good-bye.¡±
   Her face did not change. Her long auburn hair was dull and tangled. She looked as though she had aged twenty years. ¡°You¡¯ve said it. Now go away.¡±
   Part of him wanted only to flee, but he knew that if he did he might never see Bran again. He took a nervous step into the room. ¡°Please,¡± he said.
   Something cold moved in her eyes. ¡°I told you to leave,¡± she said. ¡°We don¡¯t want you here.¡±
   Once that would have sent him running. Once that might even have made him cry. Now it only made him angry. He would be a Sworn Brother of the Night¡¯s Watch soon, and face worse dangers than Catelyn Tully Stark. ¡°He¡¯s my brother,¡± he said.
   ¡°Shall I call the guards?¡±
   ¡°Call them,¡± Jon said, defiant. ¡°You can¡¯t stop me from seeing him.¡± He crossed the room, keeping the bed between them, and looked down on Bran where he lay.
   She was holding one of his hands. It looked like a claw. This was not the Bran he remembered. The flesh had all gone from him. His skin stretched tight over bones like sticks. Under the blanket, his legs bent in ways that made Jon sick. His eyes were sunken deep into black pits; open, but they saw nothing. The fall had shrunken him somehow. He looked half a leaf, as if the first strong wind would carry him off to his grave.
   Yet under the frail cage of those shattered ribs, his chest rose and fell with each shallow breath.
   ¡°Bran,¡± he said, ¡°I¡¯m sorry I didn¡¯t come before. I was afraid.¡± He could feel the tears rolling down his cheeks. Jon no longer cared. ¡°Don¡¯t die, Bran. Please. We¡¯re all waiting for you to wake up. Me and Robb and the girls, everyone?.?.?.?¡±
   Lady Stark was watching. She had not raised a cry. Jon took that for acceptance. Outside the window, the direwolf howled again. The wolf that Bran had not had time to name.
   ¡°I have to go now,¡± Jon said. ¡°Uncle Benjen is waiting. I¡¯m to go north to the Wall. We have to leave today, before the snows come.¡± He remembered how excited Bran had been at the prospect of the journey. It was more than he could bear, the thought of leaving him behind like this. Jon brushed away his tears, leaned over, and kissed his brother lightly on the lips.
   ¡°I wanted him to stay here with me,¡± Lady Stark said softly.
   Jon watched her, wary. She was not even looking at him. She was talking to him, but for a part of her, it was as though he were not even in the room.
   ¡°I prayed for it,¡± she said dully. ¡°He was my special boy. I went to the sept and prayed seven times to the seven faces of god that Ned would change his mind and leave him here with me. Sometimes prayers are answered.¡±
   Jon did not know what to say. ¡°It wasn¡¯t your fault,¡± he managed after an awkward silence.
   Her eyes found him. They were full of poison. ¡°I need none of your absolution, bastard.¡±
   Jon lowered his eyes. She was cradling one of Bran¡¯s hands. He took the other, squeezed it. Fingers like the bones of birds. ¡°Good-bye,¡± he said.
   He was at the door when she called out to him. ¡°Jon,¡± she said. He should have kept going, but she had never called him by his name before. He turned to find her looking at his face, as if she were seeing it for the first time.
   ¡°Yes?¡± he said.
   ¡°It should have been you,¡± she told him. Then she turned back to Bran and began to weep, her whole body shaking with the sobs. Jon had never seen her cry before.
   It was a long walk down to the yard.
   Outside, everything was noise and confusion. Wagons were being loaded, men were shouting, horses were being harnessed and saddled and led from the stables. A light snow had begun to fall, and everyone was in an uproar to be off.
   Robb was in the middle of it, shouting commands with the best of them. He seemed to have grown of late, as if Bran¡¯s fall and his mother¡¯s collapse had somehow made him stronger. Grey Wind was at his side.
   ¡°Uncle Benjen is looking for you,¡± he told Jon. ¡°He wanted to be gone an hour ago.¡±
   ¡°I know,¡± Jon said. ¡°Soon.¡± He looked around at all the noise and confusion. ¡°Leaving is harder than I thought.¡±
   ¡°For me too,¡± Robb said. He had snow in his hair, melting from the heat of his body. ¡°Did you see him?¡±
   Jon nodded, not trusting himself to speak.
   ¡°He¡¯s not going to die,¡± Robb said. ¡°I know it.¡±
   ¡°You Starks are hard to kill,¡± Jon agreed. His voice was flat and tired. The visit had taken all the strength from him.
   Robb knew something was wrong. ¡°My mother?.?.?.?¡±
   ¡°She was?.?.?.?very kind,¡± Jon told him.
   Robb looked relieved. ¡°Good.¡± He smiled. ¡°The next time I see you, you¡¯ll be all in black.¡±
   Jon forced himself to smile back. ¡°It was always my color. How long do you think it will be?¡±
   ¡°Soon enough,¡± Robb promised. He pulled Jon to him and embraced him fiercely. ¡°Farewell, Snow.¡±
   Jon hugged him back. ¡°And you, Stark. Take care of Bran.¡±
   ¡°I will.¡± They broke apart and looked at each other awkwardly. ¡°Uncle Benjen said to send you to the stables if I saw you,¡± Robb finally said.
   ¡°I have one more farewell to make,¡± Jon told him.
   ¡°Then I haven¡¯t seen you,¡± Robb replied. Jon left him standing there in the snow, surrounded by wagons and wolves and horses. It was a short walk to the armory. He picked up his package and took the covered bridge across to the Keep.
   Arya was in her room, packing a polished ironwood chest that was bigger than she was. Nymeria was helping. Arya would only have to point, and the wolf would bound across the room, snatch up some wisp of silk in her jaws, and fetch it back. But when she smelled Ghost, she sat down on her haunches and yelped at them.
   Arya glanced behind her, saw Jon, and jumped to her feet. She threw her skinny arms tight around his neck. ¡°I was afraid you were gone,¡± she said, her breath catching in her throat. ¡°They wouldn¡¯t let me out to say good-bye.¡±
   ¡°What did you do now?¡± Jon was amused.
   Arya disentangled herself from him and made a face. ¡°Nothing. I was all packed and everything.¡± She gestured at the huge chest, no more than a third full, and at the clothes that were scattered all over the room. ¡°Septa Mordane says I have to do it all over. My things weren¡¯t properly folded, she says. A proper southron lady doesn¡¯t just throw her clothes inside her chest like old rags, she says.¡±
   ¡°Is that what you did, little sister?¡±
   ¡°Well, they¡¯re going to get all messed up anyway,¡± she said. ¡°Who cares how they¡¯re folded?¡±
   ¡°Septa Mordane,¡± Jon told her. ¡°I don¡¯t think she¡¯d like Nymeria helping, either.¡± The she-wolf regarded him silently with her dark golden eyes. ¡°It¡¯s just as well. I have something for you to take with you, and it has to be packed very carefully.¡±
   Her face lit up. ¡°A present?¡±
   ¡°You could call it that. Close the door.¡±
   Wary but excited, Arya checked the hall. ¡°Nymeria, here. Guard.¡± She left the wolf out there to warn of intruders and closed the door. By then Jon had pulled off the rags he¡¯d wrapped it in. He held it out to her.
   Arya¡¯s eyes went wide. Dark eyes, like his. ¡°A sword,¡± she said in a small, hushed breath.
   The scabbard was soft grey leather, supple as sin. Jon drew out the blade slowly, so she could see the deep blue sheen of the steel. ¡°This is no toy,¡± he told her. ¡°Be careful you don¡¯t cut yourself. The edges are sharp enough to shave with.¡±
   ¡°Girls don¡¯t shave,¡± Arya said.
   ¡°Maybe they should. Have you ever seen the septa¡¯s legs?¡±
   She giggled at him. ¡°It¡¯s so skinny.¡±
   ¡°So are you,¡± Jon told her. ¡°I had Mikken make this special. The bravos use swords like this in Pentos and Myr and the other Free Cities. It won¡¯t hack a man¡¯s head off, but it can poke him full of holes if you¡¯re fast enough.¡±
   ¡°I can be fast,¡± Arya said.
   ¡°You¡¯ll have to work at it every day.¡± He put the sword in her hands, showed her how to hold it, and stepped back. ¡°How does it feel? Do you like the balance?¡±
   ¡°I think so,¡± Arya said.
   ¡°First lesson,¡± Jon said. ¡°Stick them with the pointy end.¡±
   Arya gave him a whap on the arm with the flat of her blade. The blow stung, but Jon found himself grinning like an idiot. ¡°I know which end to use,¡± Arya said. A doubtful look crossed her face. ¡°Septa Mordane will take it away from me.¡±
   ¡°Not if she doesn¡¯t know you have it,¡± Jon said.
   ¡°Who will I practice with?¡±
   ¡°You¡¯ll find someone,¡± Jon promised her. ¡°King¡¯s Landing is a true city, a thousand times the size of Winterfell. Until you find a partner, watch how they fight in the yard. Run, and ride, make yourself strong. And whatever you do?.?.?.?¡±
   Arya knew what was coming next. They said it together.
   ¡°?.?.?.?don¡¯t?.?.?.?tell?.?.?.? Sansa!¡±
   Jon messed up her hair. ¡°I will miss you, little sister.¡±
   Suddenly she looked like she was going to cry. ¡°I wish you were coming with us.¡±
   ¡°Different roads sometimes lead to the same castle. Who knows?¡± He was feeling better now. He was not going to let himself be sad. ¡°I better go. I¡¯ll spend my first year on the Wall emptying chamber pots if I keep Uncle Ben waiting any longer.¡±
   Arya ran to him for a last hug. ¡°Put down the sword first,¡± Jon warned her, laughing. She set it aside almost shyly and showered him with kisses.
   When he turned back at the door, she was holding it again, trying it for balance. ¡°I almost forgot,¡± he told her. ¡°All the best swords have names.¡±
   ¡°Like Ice,¡± she said. She looked at the blade in her hand. ¡°Does this have a name? Oh, tell me.¡±
   ¡°Can¡¯t you guess?¡± Jon teased. ¡°Your very favorite thing.¡±
   Arya seemed puzzled at first. Then it came to her. She was that quick. They said it together:
   ¡°Needle!¡±
   The memory of her laughter warmed him on the long ride north.
   
   11£®DAENERYS
   Daenerys Targaryen wed Khal Drogo with fear and barbaric splendor in a field beyond the walls of Pentos, for the Dothraki believed that all things of importance in a man¡¯s life must be done beneath the open sky.
   Drogo had called his khalasar to attend him and they had come, forty thousand Dothraki warriors and uncounted numbers of women, children, and slaves. Outside the city walls they camped with their vast herds, raising palaces of woven grass, eating everything in sight, and making the good folk of Pentos more anxious with every passing day.
   ¡°My fellow magisters have doubled the size of the city guard,¡± Illyrio told them over platters of honey duck and orange snap peppers one night at the manse that had been Drogo¡¯s. The khal had joined his khalasar, his estate given over to Daenerys and her brother until the wedding.
   ¡°Best we get Princess Daenerys wedded quickly before they hand half the wealth of Pentos away to sellswords and bravos,¡± Ser Jorah Mormont jested. The exile had offered her brother his sword the night Dany had been sold to Kbal Drogo; Viserys had accepted eagerly. Mormont had been their constant companion ever since.
   Magister Illyrio laughed lightly through his forked beard, but Viserys did not so much as smile. ¡°He can have her tomorrow, if he likes,¡± her brother said. He glanced over at Dany, and she lowered her eyes. ¡°So long as he pays the price.¡±
   Illyrio waved a languid hand in the air, rings glittering on his fat fingers. ¡°I have told you, all is settled. Trust me. The khal has promised you a crown, and you shall have it.¡±
   ¡°Yes, but when?¡±
   ¡°When the khal chooses,¡± Illyrio said. ¡°He will have the girl first, and after they are wed he must make his procession across the plains and present her to the dosh khaleen at Vaes Dothrak. After that, perhaps. If the omens favor war.¡±
   Viserys seethed with impatience. ¡°I piss on Dothraki omens. The Usurper sits on my father¡¯s throne. How long must I wait?¡±
   Illyrio gave a massive shrug. ¡°You have waited most of your life, great king. What is another few months, another few years?¡±
   Ser Jorah, who had traveled as far east as Vaes Dothrak, nodded in agreement. ¡°I counsel you to be patient, Your Grace. The Dothraki are true to their word, but they do things in their own time. A lesser man may beg a favor from the khal, but must never presume to berate him.¡±
   Viserys bristled. ¡°Guard your tongue, Mormont, or I¡¯ll have it out. I am no lesser man, I am the rightful Lord of the Seven Kingdoms. The dragon does not beg.¡±
   Ser Jorah lowered his eyes respectfully. Illyrio smiled enigmatically and tore a wing from the duck. Honey and grease ran over his fingers and dripped down into his beard as he nibbled at the tender meat. There are no more dragons, Dany thought, staring at her brother, though she did not dare say it aloud.
   Yet that night she dreamt of one. Viserys was hitting her, hurting her. She was naked, clumsy with fear. She ran from him, but her body seemed thick and ungainly. He struck her again. She stumbled and fell. ¡°You woke the dragon,¡± he screamed as he kicked her. ¡°You woke the dragon, you woke the dragon.¡± Her thighs were slick with blood. She closed her eyes and whimpered. As if in answer, there was a hideous ripping sound and the crackling of some great fire. When she looked again, Viserys was gone, great columns of flame rose all around, and in the midst of them was the dragon. It turned its great head slowly. When its molten eyes found hers, she woke, shaking and covered with a fine sheen of sweat. She had never been so afraid?.?.?.?
   ?.?.?.?until the day of her wedding came at last.
   The ceremony began at dawn and continued until dusk, an endless day of drinking and feasting and fighting. A mighty earthen ramp had been raised amid the grass palaces, and there Dany was seated beside Khal Drogo, above the seething sea of Dothraki. She had never seen so many people in one place, nor people so strange and frightening. The horselords might put on rich fabrics and sweet perfumes when they visited the Free Cities, but out under the open sky they kept the old ways. Men and women alike wore painted leather vests over bare chests and horsehair leggings cinched by bronze medallion belts, and the warriors greased their long braids with fat from the rendering pits. They gorged themselves on horseflesh roasted with honey and peppers, drank themselves blind on fermented mare¡¯s milk and Illyrio¡¯s fine wines, and spat jests at each other across the fires, their voices harsh and alien in Dany¡¯s ears.
   Viserys was seated just below her, splendid in a new black wool tunic with a scarlet dragon on the chest. Illyrio and Ser Jorah sat beside him. Theirs was a place of high honor, just below the khal¡¯s own bloodriders, but Dany could see the anger in her brother¡¯s lilac eyes. He did not like sitting beneath her, and he fumed when the slaves offered each dish first to the khal and his bride, and served him from the portions they refused. He could do nothing but nurse his resentment, so nurse it he did, his mood growing blacker by the hour at each insult to his person.
   Dany had never felt so alone as she did seated in the midst of that vast horde. Her brother had told her to smile, and so she smiled until her face ached and the tears came unbidden to her eyes. She did her best to hide them, knowing how angry Viserys would be if he saw her crying, terrified of how Khal Drogo might react. Food was brought to her, steaming joints of meat and thick black sausages and Dothraki blood pies, and later fruits and sweetgrass stews and delicate pastries from the kitchens of Pentos, but she waved it all away. Her stomach was a roil, and she knew she could keep none of it down.
   There was no one to talk to. Khal Drogo shouted commands and jests down to his bloodriders, and laughed at their replies, but he scarcely glanced at Dany beside him. They had no common language. Dothraki was incomprehensible to her, and the khal knew only a few words of the bastard Valyrian of the Free Cities, and none at all of the Common Tongue of the Seven Kingdoms. She would even have welcomed the conversation of Illyrio and her brother, but they were too far below to hear her.
   So she sat in her wedding silks, nursing a cup of honeyed wine, afraid to eat, talking silently to herself. I am blood of the dragon, she told herself. I am Daenerys Stormborn, Princess of Dragonstone, of the blood and seed of Aegon the Conqueror.
   The sun was only a quarter of the way up the sky when she saw her first man die. Drums were beating as some of the women danced for the khal. Drogo watched without expression, but his eyes followed their movements, and from time to time he would toss down a bronze medallion for the women to fight over.
   The warriors were watching too. One of them finally stepped into the circle, grabbed a dancer by the arm, pushed her down to the ground, and mounted her right there, as a stallion mounts a mare. Illyrio had told her that might happen. ¡°The Dothraki mate like the animals in their herds. There is no privacy in a khalasar, and they do not understand sin or shame as we do.¡±
   Dany looked away from the coupling, frightened when she realized what was happening, but a second warrior stepped forward, and a third, and soon there was no way to avert her eyes. Then two men seized the same woman. She heard a shout, saw a shove, and in the blink of an eye the arakhs were out, long razor-sharp blades, half sword and half scythe. A dance of death began as the warriors circled and slashed, leaping toward each other, whirling the blades around their heads, shrieking insults at each clash. No one made a move to interfere.
   It ended as quickly as it began. The arakhs shivered together faster than Dany could follow, one man missed a step, the other swung his blade in a flat arc. Steel bit into flesh just above the Dothraki¡¯s waist, and opened him from backbone to belly button, spilling his entrails into the dust. As the loser died, the winner took hold of the nearest woman, not even the one they had been quarreling over, and had her there and then. Slaves carried off the body, and the dancing resumed.
   Magister Illyrio had warned Dany about this too. ¡°A Dothraki wedding without at least three deaths is deemed a dull affair,¡± he had said. Her wedding must have been especially blessed; before the day was over, a dozen men had died.
   As the hours passed, the terror grew in Dany, until it was all she could do not to scream. She was afraid of the Dothraki, whose ways seemed alien and monstrous, as if they were beasts in human skins and not true men at all. She was afraid of her brother, of what he might do if she failed him. Most of all, she was afraid of what would happen tonight under the stars, when her brother gave her up to the hulking giant who sat drinking beside her with a face as still and cruel as a bronze mask.
   I am the blood of the dragon, she told herself again.
   When at last the sun was low in the sky, Khal Drogo clapped his hands together, and the drums and the shouting and feasting came to a sudden halt. Drogo stood and pulled Dany to her feet beside him. It was time for her bride gifts.
   And after the gifts, she knew, after the sun had gone down, it would be time for the first ride and the consummation of her marriage. Dany tried to put the thought aside, but it would not leave her. She hugged herself to try to keep from shaking.
   Her brother Viserys gifted her with three handmaids. Dany knew they had cost him nothing; Illyrio no doubt had provided the girls. Irri and Jhiqui were copper-skinned Dothraki with black hair and almond-shaped eyes, Doreah a fair-haired, blue-eyed Lysene girl. ¡°These are no common servants, sweet sister,¡± her brother told her as they were brought forward one by one. ¡°Illyrio and I selected them personally for you. Irri will teach you riding, Jhiqui the Dothraki tongue, and Doreah will instruct you in the womanly arts of love.¡± He smiled thinly. ¡°She¡¯s very good, Illyrio and I can both swear to that.¡±
   Ser Jorah Mormont apologized for his gift. ¡°It is a small thing, my princess, but all a poor exile could afford,¡± he said as he laid a small stack of old books before her. They were histories and songs of the Seven Kingdoms, she saw, written in the Common Tongue. She thanked him with all her heart.
   Magister Illyrio murmured a command, and four burly slaves hurried forward, bearing between them a great cedar chest bound in bronze. When she opened it, she found piles of the finest velvets and damasks the Free Cities could produce?.?.?.?and resting on top, nestled in the soft cloth, three huge eggs. Dany gasped. They were the most beautiful things she had ever seen, each different than the others, patterned in such rich colors that at first she thought they were crusted with jewels, and so large it took both of her hands to hold one. She lifted it delicately, expecting that it would be made of some fine porcelain or delicate enamel, or even blown glass, but it was much heavier than that, as if it were all of solid stone. The surface of the shell was covered with tiny scales, and as she turned the egg between her fingers, they shimmered like polished metal in the light of the setting sun. One egg was a deep green, with burnished bronze flecks that came and went depending on how Dany turned it. Another was pale cream streaked with gold. The last was black, as black as a midnight sea, yet alive with scarlet ripples and swirls. ¡°What are they?¡± she asked, her voice hushed and full of wonder.
   ¡°Dragon¡¯s eggs, from the Shadow Lands beyond Asshai,¡± said Magister Illyrio. ¡°The eons have turned them to stone, yet still they burn bright with beauty.¡±
   ¡°I shall treasure them always.¡± Dany had heard tales of such eggs, but she had never seen one, nor thought to see one. It was a truly magnificent gift, though she knew that Illyrio could afford to be lavish. He had collected a fortune in horses and slaves for his part in selling her to Khal Drogo.
   The khal¡¯s bloodriders offered her the traditional three weapons, and splendid weapons they were. Haggo gave her a great leather whip with a silver handle, Cohollo a magnificent arakh chased in gold, and Qotho a double-curved dragonbone bow taller than she was. Magister Illyrio and Ser Jorah had taught her the traditional refusals for these offerings. ¡°This is a gift worthy of a great warrior, O blood of my blood, and I am but a woman. Let my lord husband bear these in my stead.¡± And so Khal Drogo too received his ¡°bride gifts.¡±
   Other gifts she was given in plenty by other Dothraki: slippers and jewels and silver rings for her hair, medallion belts and painted vests and soft furs, sandsilks and jars of scent, needles and feathers and tiny bottles of purple glass, and a gown made from the skin of a thousand mice. ¡°A handsome gift, Khaleesi,¡± Magister Illyrio said of the last, after he had told her what it was. ¡°Most lucky.¡± The gifts mounted up around her in great piles, more gifts than she could possibly imagine, more gifts than she could want or use.
   And last of all, Khal Drogo brought forth his own bride gift to her. An expectant hush rippled out from the center of the camp as he left her side, growing until it had swallowed the whole khalasar. When he returned, the dense press of Dothraki gift-givers parted before him, and he led the horse to her.
   She was a young filly, spirited and splendid. Dany knew just enough about horses to know that this was no ordinary animal. There was something about her that took the breath away. She was grey as the winter sea, with a mane like silver smoke.
   Hesitantly she reached out and stroked the horse¡¯s neck, ran her fingers through the silver of her mane. Khal Drogo said something in Dothraki and Magister Illyrio translated. ¡°Silver for the silver of your hair, the khal says.¡±
   ¡°She¡¯s beautiful,¡± Dany murmured.
   ¡°She is the pride of the khalasar, ¡° Illyrio said. ¡°Custom decrees that the khaleesi must ride a mount worthy of her place by the side of the khal.¡±
   Drogo stepped forward and put his hands on her waist. He lifted her up as easily as if she were a child and set her on the thin Dothraki saddle, so much smaller than the ones she was used to. Dany sat there uncertain for a moment. No one had told her about this part. ¡°What should I do?¡± she asked Illyrio.
   It was Ser Jorah Mormont who answered. ¡°Take the reins and ride. You need not go far.¡±
   Nervously Dany gathered the reins in her hands and slid her feet into the short stirrups. She was only a fair rider; she had spent far more time traveling by ship and wagon and palanquin than by horseback. Praying that she would not fall off and disgrace herself, she gave the filly the lightest and most timid touch with her knees.
   And for the first time in hours, she forgot to be afraid. Or perhaps it was for the first time ever.
   The silver-grey filly moved with a smooth and silken gait, and the crowd parted for her, every eye upon them. Dany found herself moving faster than she had intended, yet somehow it was exciting rather than terrifying. The horse broke into a trot, and she smiled. Dothraki scrambled to clear a path. The slightest pressure with her legs, the lightest touch on the reins, and the filly responded. She sent it into a gallop, and now the Dothraki were hooting and laughing and shouting at her as they jumped out of her way. As she turned to ride back, a firepit loomed ahead, directly in her path. They were hemmed in on either side, with no room to stop. A daring she had never known filled Daenerys then, and she gave the filly her head.
   The silver horse leapt the flames as if she had wings.
   When she pulled up before Magister Illyrio, she said, ¡°Tell Khal Drogo that he has given me the wind.¡± The fat Pentoshi stroked his yellow beard as he repeated her words in Dothraki, and Dany saw her new husband smile for the first time.
   The last sliver of sun vanished behind the high walls of Pentos to the west just then. Dany had lost all track of time. Khal Drogo commanded his bloodriders to bring forth his own horse, a lean red stallion. As the khal was saddling the horse, Viserys slid close to Dany on her silver, dug his fingers into her leg, and said, ¡°Please him, sweet sister, or I swear, you will see the dragon wake as it has never woken before.¡±
   The fear came back to her then, with her brother¡¯s words. She felt like a child once more, only thirteen and all alone, not ready for what was about to happen to her.
   They rode out together as the stars came out, leaving the khalasar and the grass palaces behind. Khal Drogo spoke no word to her, but drove his stallion at a hard trot through the gathering dusk. The tiny silver bells in his long braid rang softly as he rode. ¡°I am the blood of the dragon,¡± she whispered aloud as she followed, trying to keep her courage up. ¡°I am the blood of the dragon. I am the blood of the dragon.¡± The dragon was never afraid.
   Afterward she could not say how far or how long they had ridden, but it was full dark when they stopped at a grassy place beside a small stream. Drogo swung off his horse and lifted her down from hers. She felt as fragile as glass in his hands, her limbs as weak as water. She stood there helpless and trembling in her wedding silks while he secured the horses, and when he turned to look at her, she began to cry.
   Khal Drogo stared at her tears, his face strangely empty of expression. ¡°No,¡± he said. He lifted his hand and rubbed away the tears roughly with a callused thumb.
   ¡°You speak the Common Tongue,¡± Dany said in wonder.
   ¡°No,¡± he said again.
   Perhaps he had only that word, she thought, but it was one word more than she had known he had, and somehow it made her feel a little better. Drogo touched her hair lightly, sliding the silver-blond strands between his fingers and murmuring softly in Dothraki. Dany did not understand the words, yet there was warmth in the tone, a tenderness she had never expected from this man.
   He put his finger under her chin and lifted her head, so she was looking up into his eyes. Drogo towered over her as he towered over everyone. Taking her lightly under the arms, he lifted her and seated her on a rounded rock beside the stream. Then he sat on the ground facing her, legs crossed beneath him, their faces finally at a height. ¡°No,¡± he said.
   ¡°Is that the only word you know?¡± she asked him.
   Drogo did not reply. His long heavy braid was coiled in the dirt beside him. He pulled it over his right shoulder and began to remove the bells from his hair, one by one. After a moment Dany leaned forward to help. When they were done, Drogo gestured. She understood. Slowly, carefully, she began to undo his braid.
   It took a long time. All the while he sat there silently, watching her. When she was done, he shook his head, and his hair spread out behind him like a river of darkness, oiled and gleaming. She had never seen hair so long, so black, so thick.
   Then it was his turn. He began to undress her.
   His fingers were deft and strangely tender. He removed her silks one by one, carefully, while Dany sat unmoving, silent, looking at his eyes. When he bared her small breasts, she could not help herself. She averted her eyes and covered herself with her hands. ¡°No,¡± Drogo said. He pulled her hands away from her breasts, gently but firmly, then lifted her face again to make her look at him. ¡°No,¡± he repeated.
   ¡°No,¡± she echoed back at him.
   He stood her up then and pulled her close to remove the last of her silks. The night air was chilly on her bare skin. She shivered, and gooseflesh covered her arms and legs. She was afraid of what would come next, but for a while nothing happened. Khal Drogo sat with his legs crossed, looking at her, drinking in her body with his eyes.
   After a while he began to touch her. Lightly at first, then harder. She could sense the fierce strength in his hands, but he never hurt her. He held her hand in his own and brushed her fingers, one by one. He ran a hand gently down her leg. He stroked her face, tracing the curve of her ears, running a finger gently around her mouth. He put both hands in her hair and combed it with his fingers. He turned her around, massaged her shoulders, slid a knuckle down the path of her spine.
   It seemed as if hours passed before his hands finally went to her breasts. He stroked the soft skin underneath until it tingled. He circled her nipples with his thumbs, pinched them between thumb and forefinger, then began to pull at her, very lightly at first, then more insistently, until her nipples stiffened and began to ache.
   He stopped then, and drew her down onto his lap. Dany was flushed and breathless, her heart fluttering in her chest. He cupped her face in his huge hands and looked into his eyes. ¡°No?¡± he said, and she knew it was a question.
   She took his hand and moved it down to the wetness between her thighs. ¡°Yes,¡± she whispered as she put his finger inside her.
   
   12£®EDDARD
   The summons came in the hour before the dawn, when the world was still and grey.
   Alyn shook him roughly from his dreams and Ned stumbled into the predawn chill, groggy from sleep, to find his horse saddled and the king already mounted. Robert wore thick brown gloves and a heavy fur cloak with a hood that covered his ears, and looked for all the world like a bear sitting a horse. ¡°Up, Stark!¡± he roared. ¡°Up, up! We have matters of state to discuss.¡±
   ¡°By all means,¡± Ned said. ¡°Come inside, Your Grace.¡± Alyn lifted the flap of the tent.
   ¡°No, no, no,¡± Robert said. His breath steamed with every word. ¡°The camp is full of ears. Besides, I want to ride out and taste this country of yours.¡± Ser Boros and Ser Meryn waited behind him with a dozen guardsmen, Ned saw. There was nothing to do but rub the sleep from his eyes, dress, and mount up.
   Robert set the pace, driving his huge black destrier hard as Ned galloped along beside him, trying to keep up. He called out a question as they rode, but the wind blew his words away, and the king did not hear him. After that Ned rode in silence. They soon left the kingsroad and took off across rolling plains dark with mist. By then the guard had fallen back a small distance, safely out of earshot, but still Robert would not slow.
   Dawn broke as they crested a low ridge, and finally the king pulled up. By then they were miles south of the main party. Robert was flushed and exhilarated as Ned reined up beside him. ¡°Gods,¡± he swore, laughing, ¡°it feels good to get out and ride the way a man was meant to ride! I swear, Ned, this creeping along is enough to drive a man mad.¡± He had never been a patient man, Robert Baratheon. ¡°That damnable wheelhouse, the way it creaks and groans, climbing every bump in the road as if it were a mountain?.?.?.?I promise you, if that wretched thing breaks another axle, I¡¯m going to burn it, and Cersei can walk!¡±
   Ned laughed. ¡°I will gladly light the torch for you.¡±
   ¡°Good man!¡± The king clapped him on the shoulder. ¡°I¡¯ve half a mind to leave them all behind and just keep going.¡±
   A smile touched Ned¡¯s lips. ¡°I do believe you mean it.¡±
   ¡°I do, I do,¡± the king said. ¡°What do you say, Ned? Just you and me, two vagabond knights on the kingsroad, our swords at our sides and the gods know what in front of us, and maybe a farmer¡¯s daughter or a tavern wench to warm our beds tonight.¡±
   ¡°Would that we could,¡± Ned said, ¡°but we have duties now, my liege?.?.?.?to the realm, to our children, I to my lady wife and you to your queen. We are not the boys we were.¡±
   ¡°You were never the boy you were,¡± Robert grumbled. ¡°More¡¯s the pity. And yet there was that one time?.?.?.?what was her name, that common girl of yours? Becca? No, she was one of mine, gods love her, black hair and these sweet big eyes, you could drown in them. Yours was?.?.?.? Aleena? No. You told me once. Was it Merryl? You know the one I mean, your bastard¡¯s mother?¡±
   ¡°Her name was Wylla,¡± Ned replied with cool courtesy, ¡°and I would sooner not speak of her.¡±
   ¡°Wylla. Yes.¡± The king grinned. ¡°She must have been a rare wench if she could make Lord Eddard Stark forget his honor, even for an hour. You never told me what she looked like?.?.?.?¡±
   Ned¡¯s mouth tightened in anger. ¡°Nor will I. Leave it be, Robert, for the love you say you bear me. I dishonored myself and I dishonored Catelyn, in the sight of gods and men.¡±
   ¡°Gods have mercy, you scarcely knew Catelyn.¡±
   ¡°I had taken her to wife. She was carrying my child.¡±
   ¡°You are too hard on yourself, Ned. You always were. Damn it, no woman wants Baelor the Blessed in her bed.¡± He slapped a hand on his knee. ¡°Well, I¡¯ll not press you if you feel so strong about it, though I swear, at times you¡¯re so prickly you ought to take the hedgehog as your sigil.¡±
   The rising sun sent fingers of light through the pale white mists of dawn. A wide plain spread out beneath them, bare and brown, its flatness here and there relieved by long, low hummocks. Ned pointed them out to his king. ¡°The barrows of the First Men.¡±
   Robert frowned. ¡°Have we ridden onto a graveyard?¡±
   ¡°There are barrows everywhere in the north, Your Grace,¡± Ned told him. ¡°This land is old.¡±
   ¡°And cold,¡± Robert grumbled, pulling his cloak more tightly around himself. The guard had reined up well behind them, at the bottom of the ridge. ¡°Well, I did not bring you out here to talk of graves or bicker about your bastard. There was a rider in the night, from Lord Varys in King¡¯s Landing. Here.¡± The king pulled a paper from his belt and handed it to Ned.
   Varys the eunuch was the king¡¯s master of whisperers. He served Robert now as he had once served Aerys Targaryen. Ned unrolled the paper with trepidation, thinking of Lysa and her terrible accusation, but the message did not concern Lady Arryn. ¡°What is the source for this information?¡±
   ¡°Do you remember Ser Jorah Mormont?¡±
   ¡°Would that I might forget him,¡± Ned said bluntly. The Mormonts of Bear Island were an old house, proud and honorable, but their lands were cold and distant and poor. Ser Jorah had tried to swell the family coffers by selling some poachers to a Tyroshi slaver. As the Mormonts were bannermen to the Starks, his crime had dishonored the north. Ned had made the long journey west to Bear Island, only to find when he arrived that Jorah had taken ship beyond the reach of Ice and the king¡¯s justice. Five years had passed since then.
   ¡°Ser Jorah is now in Pentos, anxious to earn a royal pardon that would allow him to return from exile,¡± Robert explained. ¡°Lord Varys makes good use of him.¡±
   ¡°So the slaver has become a spy,¡± Ned said with distaste. He handed the letter back. ¡°I would rather he become a corpse.¡±
   ¡°Varys tells me that spies are more useful than corpses,¡± Robert said. ¡°Jorah aside, what do you make of his report?¡±
   ¡°Daenerys Targaryen has wed some Dothraki horselord. What of it? Shall we send her a wedding gift?¡±
   The king frowned. ¡°A knife, perhaps. A good sharp one, and a bold man to wield it.¡±
   Ned did not feign surprise; Robert¡¯s hatred of the Targaryens was a madness in him. He remembered the angry words they had exchanged when Tywin Lannister had presented Robert with the corpses of Rhaegar¡¯s wife and children as a token of fealty. Ned had named that murder; Robert called it war. When he had protested that the young prince and princess were no more than babes, his new-made king had replied, ¡°I see no babes. Only dragonspawn.¡± Not even Jon Arryn had been able to calm that storm. Eddard Stark had ridden out that very day in a cold rage, to fight the last battles of the war alone in the south. It had taken another death to reconcile them; Lyanna¡¯s death, and the grief they had shared over her passing.
   This time, Ned resolved to keep his temper. ¡°Your Grace, the girl is scarcely more than a child. You are no Tywin Lannister, to slaughter innocents.¡± It was said that Rhaegar¡¯s little girl had cried as they dragged her from beneath her bed to face the swords. The boy had been no more than a babe in arms, yet Lord Tywin¡¯s soldiers had torn him from his mother¡¯s breast and dashed his head against a wall.
   ¡°And how long will this one remain an innocent?¡± Robert¡¯s mouth grew hard. ¡°This child will soon enough spread her legs and start breeding more dragonspawn to plague me.¡±
   ¡°Nonetheless,¡± Ned said, ¡°the murder of children?.?.?.?it would be vile?.?.?.?unspeakable?.?.?.?¡±
   ¡°Unspeakable?¡± the king roared. ¡°What Aerys did to your brother Brandon was unspeakable. The way your lord father died, that was unspeakable. And Rhaegar?.?.?.?how many times do you think he raped your sister? How many hundreds of times?¡± His voice had grown so loud that his horse whinnied nervously beneath him. The king jerked the reins hard, quieting the animal, and pointed an angry finger at Ned. ¡°I will kill every Targaryen I can get my hands on, until they are as dead as their dragons, and then I will piss on their graves.¡±
   Ned knew better than to defy him when the wrath was on him. If the years had not quenched Robert¡¯s thirst for revenge, no words of his would help. ¡°You can¡¯t get your hands on this one, can you?¡± he said quietly.
   The king¡¯s mouth twisted in a bitter grimace. ¡°No, gods be cursed. Some pox-ridden Pentoshi cheesemonger had her brother and her walled up on his estate with pointy-hatted eunuchs all around them, and now he¡¯s handed them over to the Dothraki. I should have had them both killed years ago, when it was easy to get at them, but Jon was as bad as you. More fool I, I listened to him.¡±
   ¡°Jon Arryn was a wise man and a good Hand.¡±
   Robert snorted. The anger was leaving him as suddenly as it had come. ¡°This Khal Drogo is said to have a hundred thousand men in his horde. What would Jon say to that?¡±
   ¡°He would say that even a million Dothraki are no threat to the realm, so long as they remain on the other side of the narrow sea,¡± Ned replied calmly. ¡°The barbarians have no ships. They hate and fear the open sea.¡±
   The king shifted uncomfortably in his saddle. ¡°Perhaps. There are ships to be had in the Free Cities, though. I tell you, Ned, I do not like this marriage. There are still those in the Seven Kingdoms who call me Usurper. Do you forget how many houses fought for Targaryen in the war? They bide their time for now, but give them half a chance, they will murder me in my bed, and my sons with me. If the beggar king crosses with a Dothraki horde at his back, the traitors will join him.¡±
   ¡°He will not cross,¡± Ned promised. ¡°And if by some mischance he does, we will throw him back into the sea. Once you choose a new Warden of the East...¡±
   The king groaned. ¡°For the last time, I will not name the Arryn boy Warden. I know the boy is your nephew, but with Targaryens climbing in bed with Dothraki, I would be mad to rest one quarter of the realm on the shoulders of a sickly child.¡±
   Ned was ready for that. ¡°Yet we still must have a Warden of the East. If Robert Arryn will not do, name one of your brothers. Stannis proved himself at the siege of Storm¡¯s End, surely.¡±
   He let the name hang there for a moment. The king frowned and said nothing. He looked uncomfortable.
   ¡°That is,¡± Ned finished quietly, watching, ¡°unless you have already promised the honor to another.¡±
   For a moment Robert had the grace to look startled. Just as quickly, the look became annoyance. ¡°What if I have?¡±
   ¡°It¡¯s Jaime Lannister, is it not?¡±
   Robert kicked his horse back into motion and started down the ridge toward the barrows. Ned kept pace with him. The king rode on, eyes straight ahead. ¡°Yes,¡± he said at last. A single hard word to end the matter.
   ¡°Kingslayer,¡± Ned said. The rumors were true, then. He rode on dangerous ground now, he knew. ¡°An able and courageous man, no doubt,¡± he said carefully, ¡°but his father is Warden of the West, Robert. In time Ser Jaime will succeed to that honor. No one man should hold both East and West.¡± He left unsaid his real concern; that the appointment would put half the armies of the realm into the hands of Lannisters.
   ¡°I will fight that battle when the enemy appears on the field,¡± the king said stubbornly. ¡°At the moment, Lord Tywin looms eternal as Casterly Rock, so I doubt that Jaime will be succeeding anytime soon. Don¡¯t vex me about this, Ned, the stone has been set.¡±
   ¡°Your Grace, may I speak frankly?¡±
   ¡°I seem unable to stop you,¡± Robert grumbled. They rode through tall brown grasses.
   ¡°Can you trust Jaime Lannister?¡±
   ¡°He is my wife¡¯s twin, a Sworn Brother of the Kingsguard, his life and fortune and honor all bound to mine.¡±
   ¡°As they were bound to Aerys Targaryen¡¯s,¡± Ned pointed out.
   ¡°Why should I mistrust him? He has done everything I have ever asked of him. His sword helped win the throne I sit on.¡±
   His sword helped taint the throne you sit on, Ned thought, but he did not permit the words to pass his lips. ¡°He swore a vow to protect his king¡¯s life with his own. Then he opened that king¡¯s throat with a sword.¡±
   ¡°Seven hells, someone had to kill Aerys!¡± Robert said, reining his mount to a sudden halt beside an ancient barrow. ¡°If Jaime hadn¡¯t done it, it would have been left for you or me.¡±
   ¡°We were not Sworn Brothers of the Kingsguard,¡± Ned said. The time had come for Robert to hear the whole truth, he decided then and there. ¡°Do you remember the Trident, Your Grace?¡±
   ¡°I won my crown there. How should I forget it?¡±
   ¡°You took a wound from Rhaegar,¡± Ned reminded him. ¡°So when the Targaryen host broke and ran, you gave the pursuit into my hands. The remnants of Rhaegar¡¯s army fled back to King¡¯s Landing. We followed. Aerys was in the Red Keep with several thousand loyalists. I expected to find the gates closed to us.¡±
   Robert gave an impatient shake of his head. ¡°Instead you found that our men had already taken the city. What of it?¡±
   ¡°Not our men,¡± Ned said patiently. ¡°Lannister men. The lion of Lannister flew over the ramparts, not the crowned stag. And they had taken the city by treachery.¡±
   The war had raged for close to a year. Lords great and small had flocked to Robert¡¯s banners; others had remained loyal to Targaryen. The mighty Lannisters of Casterly Rock, the Wardens of the West, had remained aloof from the struggle, ignoring calls to arms from both rebels and royalists. Aerys Targaryen must have thought that his gods had answered his prayers when Lord Tywin Lannister appeared before the gates of King¡¯s Landing with an army twelve thousand strong, professing loyalty. So the mad king had ordered his last mad act. He had opened his city to the lions at the gate.
   ¡°Treachery was a coin the Targaryens knew well,¡± Robert said. The anger was building in him again. ¡°Lannister paid them back in kind. It was no less than they deserved. I shall not trouble my sleep over it.¡±
   ¡°You were not there,¡± Ned said, bitterness in his voice. Troubled sleep was no stranger to him. He had lived his lies for fourteen years, yet they still haunted him at night. ¡°There was no honor in that conquest.¡±
   ¡°The Others take your honor!¡± Robert swore. ¡°What did any Targaryen ever know of honor? Go down into your crypt and ask Lyanna about the dragon¡¯s honor!¡±
   ¡°You avenged Lyanna at the Trident,¡± Ned said, halting beside the king. Promise me, Ned, she had whispered.
   ¡°That did not bring her back.¡± Robert looked away, off into the grey distance. ¡°The gods be damned. It was a hollow victory they gave me. A crown?.?.?.?it was the girl I prayed them for. Your sister, safe?.?.?.?and mine again, as she was meant to be. I ask you, Ned, what good is it to wear a crown? The gods mock the prayers of kings and cowherds alike.¡±
   ¡°I cannot answer for the gods, Your Grace?.?.?.?only for what I found when I rode into the throne room that day,¡± Ned said. ¡°Aerys was dead on the floor, drowned in his own blood. His dragon skulls stared down from the walls. Lannister¡¯s men were everywhere. Jaime wore the white cloak of the Kingsguard over his golden armor. I can see him still. Even his sword was gilded. He was seated on the Iron Throne, high above his knights, wearing a helm fashioned in the shape of a lion¡¯s head. How he glittered!¡±
   ¡°This is well known,¡± the king complained.
   ¡°I was still mounted. I rode the length of the hall in silence, between the long rows of dragon skulls. It felt as though they were watching me, somehow. I stopped in front of the throne, looking up at him. His golden sword was across his legs, its edge red with a king¡¯s blood. My men were filling the room behind me. Lannister¡¯s men drew back. I never said a word. I looked at him seated there on the throne, and I waited. At last Jaime laughed and got up. He took off his helm, and he said to me, ¡®Have no fear, Stark. I was only keeping it warm for our friend Robert. It¡¯s not a very comfortable seat, I¡¯m afraid.¡¯ ¡±
   The king threw back his head and roared. His laughter startled a flight of crows from the tall brown grass. They took to the air in a wild beating of wings. ¡°You think I should mistrust Lannister because he sat on my throne for a few moments?¡± He shook with laughter again. ¡°Jaime was all of seventeen, Ned. Scarce more than a boy.¡±
   ¡°Boy or man, he had no right to that throne.¡±
   ¡°Perhaps he was tired,¡± Robert suggested. ¡°Killing kings is weary work. Gods know, there¡¯s no place else to rest your ass in that damnable room. And he spoke truly, it is a monstrous uncomfortable chair. In more ways than one.¡± The king shook his head. ¡°Well, now I know Jaime¡¯s dark sin, and the matter can be forgotten. I am heartily sick of secrets and squabbles and matters of state, Ned. It¡¯s all as tedious as counting coppers. Come, let¡¯s ride, you used to know how. I want to feel the wind in my hair again.¡± He kicked his horse back into motion 	galloped up over the barrow, raining earth down behind him.
   For a moment Ned did not follow. He had run out of words, and he was filled with a vast sense of helplessness. Not for the first time, he wondered what he was doing here and why he had come. He was no Jon Arryn, to curb the wildness of his king and teach him wisdom. Robert would do what he pleased, as he always had, and nothing Ned could say or do would change that. He belonged in Winterfell. He belonged with Catelyn in her grief, and with Bran.
   A man could not always be where he belonged, though. Resigned, Eddard Stark put his boots into his horse and set off after the king.
   
   13£®TYRION
   The north went on forever.
   Tyrion Lannister knew the maps as well as anyone, but a fortnight on the wild track that passed for the kingsroad up here had brought home the lesson that the map was one thing and the land quite another.
   They had left Winterfell on the same day as the king, amidst all the commotion of the royal departure, riding out to the sound of men shouting and horses snorting, to the rattle of wagons and the groaning of the queen¡¯s huge wheelhouse, as a light snow flurried about them. The kingsroad was just beyond the sprawl of castle and town. There the banners and the wagons and the columns of knights and freeriders turned south, taking the tumult with them, while Tyrion turned north with Benjen Stark and his nephew.
   It had grown colder after that, and far more quiet.
   West of the road were flint hills, grey and rugged, with tall watchtowers on their stony summits. To the east the land was lower, the ground flattening to a rolling plain that stretched away as far as the eye could see. Stone bridges spanned swift, narrow rivers, while small farms spread in rings around holdfasts walled in wood and stone. The road was well trafficked, and at night for their comfort there were rude inns to be found.
   Three days ride from Winterfell, however, the farmland gave way to dense wood, and the kingsroad grew lonely. The flint hills rose higher and wilder with each passing mile, until by the fifth day they had turned into mountains, cold blue-grey giants with jagged promontories and snow on their shoulders. When the wind blew from the north, long plumes of ice crystals flew from the high peaks like banners.
   With the mountains a wall to the west, the road veered north by northeast through the wood, a forest of oak and evergreen and black brier that seemed older and darker than any Tyrion had ever seen. ¡°The wolfswood,¡± Benjen Stark called it, and indeed their nights came alive with the howls of distant packs, and some not so distant. Jon Snow¡¯s albino direwolf pricked up his ears at the nightly howling, but never raised his own voice in reply. There was something very unsettling about that animal, Tyrion thought.
   There were eight in the party by then, not counting the wolf. Tyrion traveled with two of his own men, as befit a Lannister. Benjen Stark had only his bastard nephew and some fresh mounts for the Night¡¯s Watch, but at the edge of the wolfswood they stayed a night behind the wooden walls of a forest holdfast, and there joined up with another of the black brothers, one Yoren. Yoren was stooped and sinister, his features hidden behind a beard as black as his clothing, but he seemed as tough as an old root and as hard as stone. With him were a pair of ragged peasant boys from the Fingers. ¡°Rapers,¡± Yoren said with a cold look at his charges. Tyrion understood. Life on the Wall was said to be hard, but no doubt it was preferable to castration.
   Five men, three boys, a direwolf, twenty horses, and a cage of ravens given over to Benjen Stark by Maester Luwin. No doubt they made a curious fellowship for the kingsroad, or any road.
   Tyrion noticed Jon Snow watching Yoren and his sullen companions, with an odd cast to his face that looked uncomfortably like dismay. Yoren had a twisted shoulder and a sour smell, his hair and beard were matted and greasy and full of lice, his clothing old, patched, and seldom washed. His two young recruits smelled even worse, and seemed as stupid as they were cruel.
   No doubt the boy had made the mistake of thinking that the Night¡¯s Watch was made up of men like his uncle. If so, Yoren and his companions were a rude awakening. Tyrion felt sorry for the boy. He had chosen a hard life?.?.?.?or perhaps he should say that a hard life had been chosen for him.
   He had rather less sympathy for the uncle. Benjen Stark seemed to share his brother¡¯s distaste for Lannisters, and he had not been pleased when Tyrion had told him of his intentions. ¡°I warn you, Lannister, you¡¯ll find no inns at the Wall,¡± he had said, looking down on him.
   ¡°No doubt you¡¯ll find some place to put me,¡± Tyrion had replied. ¡°As you might have noticed, I¡¯m small.¡±
   One did not say no to the queen¡¯s brother, of course, so that had settled the matter, but Stark had not been happy. ¡°You will not like the ride, I promise you that,¡± he¡¯d said curtly, and since the moment they set out, he had done all he could to live up to that promise.
   By the end of the first week, Tyrion¡¯s thighs were raw from hard riding, his legs were cramping badly, and he was chilled to the bone. He did not complain. He was damned if he would give Benjen Stark that satisfaction.
   He took a small revenge in the matter of his riding fur, a tattered bearskin, old and musty-smelling. Stark had offered it to him in an excess of Night¡¯s Watch gallantry, no doubt expecting him to graciously decline. Tyrion had accepted with a smile. He had brought his warmest clothing with him when they rode out of Winterfell, and soon discovered that it was nowhere near warm enough. It was cold up here, and growing colder. The nights were well below freezing now, and when the wind blew it was like a knife cutting right through his warmest woolens. By now Stark was no doubt regretting his chivalrous impulse. Perhaps he had learned a lesson. The Lannisters never declined, graciously or otherwise. The Lannisters took what was offered.
   Farms and holdfasts grew scarcer and smaller as they pressed northward, ever deeper into the darkness of the wolfswood, until finally there were no more roofs to shelter under, and they were thrown back on their own resources.
   Tyrion was never much use in making a camp or breaking one. Too small, too hobbled, too in-the-way. So while Stark and Yoren and the other men erected rude shelters, tended the horses, and built a fire, it became his custom to take his fur and a wineskin and go off by himself to read.
   On the eighteenth night of their journey, the wine was a rare sweet amber from the Summer Isles that he had brought all the way north from Casterly Rock, and the book a rumination on the history and properties of dragons. With Lord Eddard Stark¡¯s permission, Tyrion had borrowed a few rare volumes from the Winterfell library and packed them for the ride north.
   He found a comfortable spot just beyond the noise of the camp, beside a swift-running stream with waters clear and cold as ice. A grotesquely ancient oak provided shelter from the biting wind. Tyrion curled up in his fur with his back against the trunk, took a sip of the wine, and began to read about the properties of dragonbone. Dragonbone is black because of its high iron content, the book told him. It is strong as steel, yet lighter and far more flexible, and of course utterly impervious to fire. Dragonbone bows are greatly prized by the Dothraki, and small wonder. An archer so armed can outrange any wooden bow.
   Tyrion had a morbid fascination with dragons. When he had first come to King¡¯s Landing for his sister¡¯s wedding to Robert Baratheon, he had made it a point to seek out the dragon skulls that had hung on the walls of Targaryen¡¯s throne room. King Robert had replaced them with banners and tapestries, but Tyrion had persisted until he found the skulls in the dank cellar where they had been stored.
   He had expected to find them impressive, perhaps even frightening. He had not thought to find them beautiful. Yet they were. As black as onyx, polished smooth, so the bone seemed to shimmer in the light of his torch. They liked the fire, he sensed. He¡¯d thrust the torch into the mouth of one of the larger skulls and made the shadows leap and dance on the wall behind him. The teeth were long, curving knives of black diamond. The flame of the torch was nothing to them; they had bathed in the heat of far greater fires. When he had moved away, Tyrion could have sworn that the beast¡¯s empty eye sockets had watched him go.
   There were nineteen skulls. The oldest was more than three thousand years old; the youngest a mere century and a half. The most recent were also the smallest; a matched pair no bigger than mastiff¡¯s skulls, and oddly misshapen, all that remained of the last two hatchlings born on Dragonstone. They were the last of the Targaryen dragons, perhaps the last dragons anywhere, and they had not lived very long.
   From there the skulls ranged upward in size to the three great monsters of song and story, the dragons that Aegon Targaryen and his sisters had unleashed on the Seven Kingdoms of old. The singers had given them the names of gods: Balerion, Meraxes, Vhaghar. Tyrion had stood between their gaping jaws, wordless and awed. You could have ridden a horse down Vhaghar¡¯s gullet, although you would not have ridden it out again. Meraxes was even bigger. And the greatest of them, Balerion, the Black Dread, could have swallowed an aurochs whole, or even one of the hairy mammoths said to roam the cold wastes beyond the Port of Ibben.
   Tyrion stood in that dank cellar for a long time, staring at Balerion¡¯s huge, empty-eyed skull until his torch burned low, trying to grasp the size of the living animal, to imagine how it must have looked when it spread its great black wings and swept across the skies, breathing fire.
   His own remote ancestor, King Loren of the Rock, had tried to stand against the fire when he joined with King Mern of the Reach to oppose the Targaryen conquest. That was close on three hundred years ago, when the Seven Kingdoms were kingdoms, and not mere provinces of a greater realm. Between them, the Two Kings had six hundred banners flying, five thousand mounted knights, and ten times as many freeriders and men-at-arms. Aegon Dragonlord had perhaps a fifth that number, the chroniclers said, and most of those were conscripts from the ranks of the last king he had slain, their loyalties uncertain.
   The hosts met on the broad plains of the Reach, amidst golden fields of wheat ripe for harvest. When the Two Kings charged, the Targaryen army shivered and shattered and began to run. For a few moments, the chroniclers wrote, the conquest was at an end?.?.?.?but only for those few moments, before Aegon Targaryen and his sisters joined the battle.
   It was the only time that Vhaghar, Meraxes, and Balerion were all unleashed at once. The singers called it the Field of Fire.
   Near four thousand men had burned that day, among them King Mern of the Reach. King Loren had escaped, and lived long enough to surrender, pledge his fealty to the Targaryens, and beget a son, for which Tyrion was duly grateful.
   ¡°Why do you read so much?¡±
   Tyrion looked up at the sound of the voice. Jon Snow was standing a few feet away, regarding him curiously. He closed the book on a finger and said, ¡°Look at me and tell me what you see.¡±
   The boy looked at him suspiciously. ¡°Is this some kind of trick? I see you. Tyrion Lannister.¡±
   Tyrion sighed. ¡°You are remarkably polite for a bastard, Snow. What you see is a dwarf. You are what, twelve?¡±
   ¡°Fourteen,¡± the boy said.
   ¡°Fourteen, and you¡¯re taller than I will ever be. My legs are short and twisted, and I walk with difficulty. I require a special saddle to keep from falling off my horse. A saddle of my own design, you may be interested to know. It was either that or ride a pony. My arms are strong enough, but again, too short. I will never make a swordsman. Had I been born a peasant, they might have left me out to die, or sold me to some slaver¡¯s grotesquerie. Alas, I was born a Lannister of Casterly Rock, and the grotesqueries are all the poorer. Things are expected of me. My father was the Hand of the King for twenty years. My brother later killed that very same king, as it turns out, but life is full of these little ironies. My sister married the new king and my repulsive nephew will be king after him. I must do my part for the honor of my House, wouldn¡¯t you agree? Yet how? Well, my legs may be too small for my body, but my head is too large, although I prefer to think it is just large enough for my mind. I have a realistic grasp of my own strengths and weaknesses. My mind is my weapon. My brother has his sword, King Robert has his warhammer, and I have my mind?.?.?.?and a mind needs books as a sword needs a whetstone, if it is to keep its edge.¡± Tyrion tapped the leather cover of the book. ¡°That¡¯s why I read so much, Jon Snow.¡±
   The boy absorbed that all in silence. He had the Stark face if not the name: long, solemn, guarded, a face that gave nothing away. Whoever his mother had been, she had left little of herself in her son. ¡°What are you reading about?¡± he asked.
   ¡°Dragons,¡± Tyrion told him.
   ¡°What good is that? There are no more dragons,¡± the boy said with the easy certainty of youth.
   ¡°So they say,¡± Tyrion replied. ¡°Sad, isn¡¯t it? When I was your age, used to dream of having a dragon of my own.¡±
   ¡°You did?¡± the boy said suspiciously. Perhaps he thought Tyrion was making fun of him.
   ¡°Oh, yes. Even a stunted, twisted, ugly little boy can look down over the world when he¡¯s seated on a dragon¡¯s back.¡± Tyrion pushed the bearskin aside and climbed to his feet. ¡°I used to start fires in the bowels of Casterly Rock and stare at the flames for hours, pretending they were dragonfire. Sometimes I¡¯d imagine my father burning. At other times, my sister.¡± Jon Snow was staring at him, a look equal parts horror and fascination. Tyrion guffawed. ¡°Don¡¯t look at me that way, bastard. I know your secret. You¡¯ve dreamt the same kind of dreams.¡±
   ¡°No,¡± Jon Snow said, horrified. ¡°I wouldn¡¯t?.?.?.?¡±
   ¡°No? Never?¡± Tyrion raised an eyebrow. ¡°Well, no doubt the Starks have been terribly good to you. I¡¯m certain Lady Stark treats you as if you were one of her own. And your brother Robb, he¡¯s always been kind, and why not? He gets Winterfell and you get the Wall. And your father?.?.?.?he must have good reasons for packing you off to the Night¡¯s Watch?.?.?.?¡±
   ¡°Stop it,¡± Jon Snow said, his face dark with anger. ¡°The Night¡¯s Watch is a noble calling!¡±
   Tyrion laughed. ¡°You¡¯re too smart to believe that. The Night¡¯s Watch is a midden heap for all the misfits of the realm. I¡¯ve seen you looking at Yoren and his boys. Those are your new brothers, Jon Snow, how do you like them? Sullen peasants, debtors, poachers, rapers, thieves, and bastards like you all wind up on the Wall, watching for grumkins and snarks and all the other monsters your wet nurse warned you about. The good part is there are no grumkins or snarks, so it¡¯s scarcely dangerous work. The bad part is you freeze your balls off, but since you¡¯re not allowed to breed anyway, I don¡¯t suppose that matters.¡±
   ¡°Stop it!¡± the boy screamed. He took a step forward, his hands coiling into fists, close to tears.
   Suddenly, absurdly, Tyrion felt guilty. He took a step forward, intending to give the boy a reassuring pat on the shoulder or mutter some word of apology.
   He never saw the wolf, where it was or how it came at him. One moment he was walking toward Snow and the next he was flat on his back on the hard rocky ground, the book spinning away from him as he fell, the breath going out of him at the sudden impact, his mouth full of dirt and blood and rotting leaves. As he tried to get up, his back spasmed painfully. He must have wrenched it in the fall. He ground his teeth in frustration, grabbed a root, and pulled himself back to a sitting position. ¡°Help me,¡± he said to the boy, reaching up a hand.
   And suddenly the wolf was between them. He did not growl. The damned thing never made a sound. He only looked at him with those bright red eyes, and showed him his teeth, and that was more than enough. Tyrion sagged back to the ground with a grunt. ¡°Don¡¯t help me, then. I¡¯ll sit right here until you leave.¡±
   Jon Snow stroked Ghost¡¯s thick white fur, smiling now. ¡°Ask me nicely.¡±
   Tyrion Lannister felt the anger coiling inside him, and crushed it out with a will. It was not the first time in his life he had been humiliated, and it would not be the last. Perhaps he even deserved this. ¡°I should be very grateful for your kind assistance, Jon,¡± he said mildly.
   ¡°Down, Ghost,¡± the boy said. The direwolf sat on his haunches. Those red eyes never left Tyrion. Jon came around behind him, slid his hands under his arms, and lifted him easily to his feet. Then he picked up the book and handed it back.
   ¡°Why did he attack me?¡± Tyrion asked with a sidelong glance at the direwolf. He wiped blood and dirt from his mouth with the back of his hand.
   ¡°Maybe he thought you were a grumkin.¡±
   Tyrion glanced at him sharply. Then he laughed, a raw snort of amusement that came bursting out through his nose entirely without his permission. ¡°Oh, gods,¡± he said, choking on his laughter and shaking his head, ¡°I suppose I do rather look like a grumkin. What does he do to snarks?¡±
   ¡°You don¡¯t want to know.¡± Jon picked up the wineskin and handed it to Tyrion.
   Tyrion pulled out the stopper, tilted his head, and squeezed a long stream into his mouth. The wine was cool fire as it trickled down his throat and warmed his belly. He held out the skin to Jon Snow. ¡°Want some?¡±
   The boy took the skin and tried a cautious swallow. ¡°It¡¯s true, isn¡¯t it?¡± he said when he was done. ¡°What you said about the Night¡¯s Watch.¡±
   Tyrion nodded.
   Jon Snow set his mouth in a grim line. ¡°If that¡¯s what it is, that¡¯s what it is.¡±
   Tyrion grinned at him. ¡°That¡¯s good, bastard. Most men would rather deny a hard truth than face it.¡±
   ¡°Most men,¡± the boy said. ¡°But not you.¡±
   ¡°No,¡± Tyrion admitted, ¡°not me. I seldom even dream of dragons anymore. There are no dragons.¡± He scooped up the fallen bearskin. ¡°Come, we had better return to camp before your uncle calls the banners.¡±
   The walk was short, but the ground was rough underfoot and his legs were cramping badly by the time they got back. Jon Snow offered a hand to help him over a thick tangle of roots, but Tyrion shook him off. He would make his own way, as he had all his life. Still, the camp was a welcome sight. The shelters had been thrown up against the tumbledown wall of a long-abandoned holdfast, a shield against the wind. The horses had been fed and a fire had been laid. Yoren sat on a stone, skinning a squirrel. The savory smell of stew filled Tyrion¡¯s nostrils. He dragged himself over to where his man Morrec was tending the stewpot. Wordlessly, Morrec handed him the ladle. Tyrion tasted and handed it back. ¡°More pepper,¡± he said.
   Benjen Stark emerged from the shelter he shared with his nephew. ¡°There you are. Jon, damn it, don¡¯t go off like that by yourself. I thought the Others had gotten you.¡±
   ¡°It was the grumkins,¡± Tyrion told him, laughing. Jon Snow smiled. Stark shot a baffled look at Yoren. The old man grunted, shrugged, and went back to his bloody work.
   The squirrel gave some body to the stew, and they ate it with black bread and hard cheese that night around their fire. Tyrion shared around his skin of wine until even Yoren grew mellow. One by one the company drifted off to their shelters and to sleep, all but Jon Snow, who had drawn the night¡¯s first watch.
   Tyrion was the last to retire, as always. As he stepped into the shelter his men had built for him, he paused and looked back at Jon Snow. The boy stood near the fire, his face still and hard, looking deep into the flames.
   Tyrion Lannister smiled sadly and went to bed.
   
   14£®CATELYN
   Ned and the girls were eight days gone when Maester Luwin came to her one night in Bran¡¯s sickroom, carrying a reading lamp and the books of account. ¡°It is past time that we reviewed the figures, my lady,¡± he said. ¡°You¡¯ll want to know how much this royal visit cost us.¡±
   Catelyn looked at Bran in his sickbed and brushed his hair back off his forehead. It had grown very long, she realized. She would have to cut it soon. ¡°I have no need to look at figures, Maester Luwin,¡± she told him, never taking her eyes from Bran. ¡°I know what the visit cost us. Take the books away.¡±
   ¡°My lady, the king¡¯s party had healthy appetites. We must replenish our stores before...¡±
   She cut him off. ¡°I said, take the books away. The steward will attend to our needs.¡±
   ¡°We have no steward,¡± Maester Luwin reminded her. Like a little grey rat, she thought, he would not let go. ¡°Poole went south to establish Lord Eddard¡¯s household at King¡¯s Landing.¡±
   Catelyn nodded absently. ¡°Oh, yes. I remember.¡± Bran looked so pale. She wondered whether they might move his bed under the window, so he could get the morning sun.
   Maester Luwin set the lamp in a niche by the door and fiddled with its wick. ¡°There are several appointments that require your immediate attention, my lady. Besides the steward, we need a captain of the guards to fill Jory¡¯s place, a new master of horse...¡±
   Her eyes snapped around and found him. ¡°A master of horse?¡± Her voice was a whip.
   The maester was shaken. ¡°Yes, my lady. Hullen rode south with Lord Eddard, so...¡±
   ¡°My son lies here broken and dying, Luwin, and you wish to discuss a new master of horse? Do you think I care what happens in the stables? Do you think it matters to me one whit? I would gladly butcher every horse in Winterfell with my own hands if it would open Bran¡¯s eyes, do you understand that? Do you?¡±
   He bowed his head. ¡°Yes, my lady, but the appointments...¡±
   ¡°I¡¯ll make the appointments,¡± Robb said.
   Catelyn had not heard him enter, but there he stood in the doorway, looking at her. She had been shouting, she realized with a sudden flush of shame. What was happening to her? She was so tired, and her head hurt all the time.
   Maester Luwin looked from Catelyn to her son. ¡°I have prepared a list of those we might wish to consider for the vacant offices,¡± he said, offering Robb a paper plucked from his sleeve.
   Her son glanced at the names. He had come from outside, Catelyn saw; his cheeks were red from the cold, his hair shaggy and windblown. ¡°Good men,¡± he said. ¡°We¡¯ll talk about them tomorrow.¡± He handed back the list of names.
   ¡°Very good, my lord.¡± The paper vanished into his sleeve.
   ¡°Leave us now,¡± Robb said. Maester Luwin bowed and departed. Robb closed the door behind him and turned to her. He was wearing a sword, she saw. ¡°Mother, what are you doing?¡±
   Catelyn had always thought Robb looked like her; like Bran and Rickon and Sansa, he had the Tully coloring, the auburn hair, the blue eyes. Yet now for the first time she saw something of Eddard Stark in his face, something as stern and hard as the north. ¡°What am I doing?¡± she echoed, puzzled. ¡°How can you ask that? What do you imagine I¡¯m doing? I am taking care of your brother. I am taking care of Bran.¡±
   ¡°Is that what you call it? You haven¡¯t left this room since Bran was hurt. You didn¡¯t even come to the gate when Father and the girls went south.¡±
   ¡°I said my farewells to them here, and watched them ride out from that window.¡± She had begged Ned not to go, not now, not after what had happened; everything had changed now, couldn¡¯t he see that? It was no use. He had no choice, he had told her, and then he left, choosing. ¡°I can¡¯t leave him, even for a moment, not when any moment could be his last. I have to be with him, if?.?.?.?if?.?.?.?¡± She took her son¡¯s limp hand, sliding his fingers through her own. He was so frail and thin, with no strength left in his hand, but she could still feel the warmth of life through his skin.
   Robb¡¯s voice softened. ¡°He¡¯s not going to die, Mother. Maester Luwin says the time of greatest danger has passed.¡±
   ¡°And what if Maester Luwin is wrong? What if Bran needs me and I¡¯m not here?¡±
   ¡°Rickon needs you,¡± Robb said sharply. ¡°He¡¯s only three, he doesn¡¯t understand what¡¯s happening. He thinks everyone has deserted him, so he follows me around all day, clutching my leg and crying. I don¡¯t know what to do with him.¡± He paused a moment, chewing on his lower lip the way he¡¯d done when he was little. ¡°Mother, I need you too. I¡¯m trying but I can¡¯t?.?.?.?I can¡¯t do it all by myself.¡± His voice broke with sudden emotion, and Catelyn remembered that he was only fourteen. She wanted to get up and go to him, but Bran was still holding her hand and she could not move.
   Outside the tower, a wolf began to howl. Catelyn trembled, just for a second.
   ¡°Bran¡¯s.¡± Robb opened the window and let the night air into the stuffy tower room. The howling grew louder. It was a cold and lonely sound, full of melancholy and despair.
   ¡°Don¡¯t,¡± she told him. ¡°Bran needs to stay warm.¡±
   ¡°He needs to hear them sing,¡± Robb said. Somewhere out in Winterfell, a second wolf began to howl in chorus with the first. Then a third, closer. ¡°Shaggydog and Grey Wind,¡± Robb said as their voices rose and fell together. ¡°You can tell them apart if you listen close.¡±
   Catelyn was shaking. It was the grief, the cold, the howling of the direwolves. Night after night, the howling and the cold wind and the grey empty castle, on and on they went, never changing, and her boy lying there broken, the sweetest of her children, the gentlest, Bran who loved to laugh and climb and dreamt of knighthood, all gone now, she would never hear him laugh again. Sobbing, she pulled her hand free of his and covered her ears against those terrible howls. ¡°Make them stop!¡± she cried. ¡°I can¡¯t stand it, make them stop, make them stop, kill them all if you must, just make them stop!¡±
   She didn¡¯t remember falling to the floor, but there she was, and Robb was lifting her, holding her in strong arms. ¡°Don¡¯t be afraid, Mother. They would never hurt him.¡± He helped her to her narrow bed in the corner of the sickroom. ¡°Close your eyes,¡± he said gently. ¡°Rest. Maester Luwin tells me you¡¯ve hardly slept since Bran¡¯s fall.¡±
   ¡°I can¡¯t,¡± she wept. ¡°Gods forgive me, Robb, I can¡¯t, what if he dies while I¡¯m asleep, what if he dies, what if he dies?.?.?.?¡± The wolves were still howling. She screamed and held her ears again. ¡°Oh, gods, close the window!¡±
   ¡°If you swear to me you¡¯ll sleep.¡± Robb went to the window, but as he reached for the shutters another sound was added to the mournful howling of the direwolves. ¡°Dogs,¡± he said, listening. ¡°All the dogs are barking. They¡¯ve never done that before?.?.?.?¡± Catelyn heard his breath catch in his throat. When she looked up, his face was pale in the lamplight. ¡°Fire,¡± he whispered.
   Fire, she thought, and then, Bran! ¡°Help me,¡± she said urgently, sitting up. ¡°Help me with Bran.¡±
   Robb did not seem to hear her. ¡°The library tower¡¯s on fire,¡± he said.
   Catelyn could see the flickering reddish light through the open window now. She sagged with relief. Bran was safe. The library was across the bailey, there was no way the fire would reach them here. ¡°Thank the gods,¡± she whispered.
   Robb looked at her as if she¡¯d gone mad. ¡°Mother, stay here. I¡¯ll come back as soon as the fire¡¯s out.¡± He ran then. She heard him shout to the guards outside the room, heard them descending together in a wild rush, taking the stairs two and three at a time.
   Outside, there were shouts of ¡°Fire!¡± in the yard, screams, running footsteps, the whinny of frightened horses, and the frantic barking of the castle dogs. The howling was gone, she realized as she listened to the cacophony. The direwolves had fallen silent.
   Catelyn said a silent prayer of thanks to the seven faces of god as she went to the window. Across the bailey, long tongues of flame shot from the windows of the library. She watched the smoke rise into the sky and thought sadly of all the books the Starks had gathered over the centuries. Then she closed the shutters.
   When she turned away from the window, the man was in the room with her.
   ¡°You weren¡¯t s¡¯posed to be here,¡± he muttered sourly. ¡°No one was s¡¯posed to be here.¡±
   He was a small, dirty man in filthy brown clothing, and he stank of horses. Catelyn knew all the men who worked in their stables, and he was none of them. He was gaunt, with limp blond hair and pale eyes deep-sunk in a bony face, and there was a dagger in his hand.
   Catelyn looked at the knife, then at Bran. ¡°No,¡± she said. The word stuck in her throat, the merest whisper.
   He must have heard her. ¡°It¡¯s a mercy,¡± he said. ¡°He¡¯s dead already.¡±
   ¡°No,¡± Catelyn said, louder now as she found her voice again. ¡°No, you can¡¯t.¡± She spun back toward the window to scream for help, but the man moved faster than she would have believed. One hand clamped down over her mouth and yanked back her head, the other brought the dagger up to her windpipe. The stench of him was overwhelming.
   She reached up with both hands and grabbed the blade with all her strength, pulling it away from her throat. She heard him cursing into her ear. Her fingers were slippery with blood, but she would not let go of the dagger. The hand over her mouth clenched more tightly, shutting off her air. Catelyn twisted her head to the side and managed to get a piece of his flesh between her teeth. She bit down hard into his palm. The man grunted in pain. She ground her teeth together and tore at him, and all of a sudden he let go. The taste of his blood filled her mouth. She sucked in air and screamed, and he grabbed her hair and pulled her away from him, and she stumbled and went down, and then he was standing over her, breathing hard, shaking. The dagger was still clutched tightly in his right hand, slick with blood. ¡°You weren¡¯t s¡¯posed to be here,¡± he repeated stupidly.
   Catelyn saw the shadow slip through the open door behind him. There was a low rumble, less than a snarl, the merest whisper of a threat, but he must have heard something, because he started to turn just as the wolf made its leap. They went down together, half sprawled over Catelyn where she¡¯d fallen. The wolf had him under the jaw. The man¡¯s shriek lasted less than a second before the beast wrenched back its head, taking out half his throat.
   His blood felt like warm rain as it sprayed across her face.
   The wolf was looking at her. Its jaws were red and wet and its eyes glowed golden in the dark room. It was Bran¡¯s wolf, she realized. Of course it was. ¡°Thank you,¡± Catelyn whispered, her voice faint and tiny. She lifted her hand, trembling. The wolf padded closer, sniffed at her fingers, then licked at the blood with a wet rough tongue. When it had cleaned all the blood off her hand, it turned away silently and jumped up on Bran¡¯s bed and lay down beside him. Catelyn began to laugh hysterically.
   That was the way they found them, when Robb and Maester Luwin and Ser Rodrik burst in with half the guards in Winterfell. When the laughter finally died in her throat, they wrapped her in warm blankets and led her back to the Great Keep, to her own chambers. Old Nan undressed her and helped her into a scalding hot bath and washed the blood off her with a soft cloth.
   Afterward Maester Luwin arrived to dress her wounds. The cuts in her fingers went deep, almost to the bone, and her scalp was raw and bleeding where he¡¯d pulled out a handful of hair. The maester told her the pain was just starting now, and gave her milk of the poppy to help her sleep.
   Finally she closed her eyes.
   When she opened them again, they told her that she had slept four days. Catelyn nodded and sat up in bed. It all seemed like a nightmare to her now, everything since Bran¡¯s fall, a terrible dream of blood and grief, but she had the pain in her hands to remind her that it was real. She felt weak and light-headed, yet strangely resolute, as if a great weight had lifted from her.
   ¡°Bring me some bread and honey,¡± she told her servants, ¡°and take word to Maester Luwin that my bandages want changing.¡± They looked at her in surprise and ran to do her bidding.
   Catelyn remembered the way she had been before, and she was ashamed. She had let them all down, her children, her husband, her House. It would not happen again. She would show these northerners how strong a Tully of Riverrun could be.
   Robb arrived before her food. Rodrik Cassel came with him, and her husband¡¯s ward Theon Greyjoy, and lastly Hallis Mollen, a muscular guardsman with a square brown beard. He was the new captain of the guard, Robb said. Her son was dressed in boiled leather and ringmail, she saw, and a sword hung at his waist.
   ¡°Who was he?¡± Catelyn asked them.
   ¡°No one knows his name,¡± Hallis Mollen told her. ¡°He was no man of Winterfell, m¡¯lady, but some says they seen him here and about the castle these past few weeks.¡±
   ¡°One of the king¡¯s men, then,¡± she said, ¡°or one of the Lannisters¡¯. He could have waited behind when the others left.¡±
   ¡°Maybe,¡± Hal said. ¡°With all these strangers filling up Winterfell of late, there¡¯s no way of saying who he belonged to.¡±
   ¡°He¡¯d been hiding in your stables,¡± Greyjoy said. ¡°You could smell it on him.¡±
   ¡°And how could he go unnoticed?¡± she said sharply.
   Hallis Mollen looked abashed. ¡°Between the horses Lord Eddard took south and them we sent north to the Night¡¯s Watch, the stalls were half-empty. It were no great trick to hide from the stableboys. Could be Hodor saw him, the talk is that boy¡¯s been acting queer, but simple as he is?.?.?.?¡± Hal shook his head.
   ¡°We found where he¡¯d been sleeping,¡± Robb put in. ¡°He had ninety silver stags in a leather bag buried beneath the straw.¡±
   ¡°It¡¯s good to know my son¡¯s life was not sold cheaply,¡± Catelyn said bitterly.
   Hallis Mollen looked at her, confused. ¡°Begging your grace, m¡¯lady, you saying he was out to kill your boy?¡±
   Greyjoy was doubtful. ¡°That¡¯s madness.¡±
   ¡°He came for Bran,¡± Catelyn said. ¡°He kept muttering how I wasn¡¯t supposed to be there. He set the library fire thinking I would rush to put it out, taking any guards with me. If I hadn¡¯t been half-mad with grief, it would have worked.¡±
   ¡°Why would anyone want to kill Bran?¡± Robb said. ¡°Gods, he¡¯s only a little boy, helpless, sleeping?.?.?.?¡±
   Catelyn gave her firstborn a challenging look. ¡°If you are to rule in the north, you must think these things through, Robb. Answer your own question. Why would anyone want to kill a sleeping child?¡±
   Before he could answer, the servants returned with a plate of food fresh from the kitchen. There was much more than she¡¯d asked for: hot bread, butter and honey and blackberry preserves, a rasher of bacon and a soft-boiled egg, a wedge of cheese, a pot of mint tea. And with it came Maester Luwin.
   ¡°How is my son, Maester?¡± Catelyn looked at all the food and found she had no appetite.
   Maester Luwin lowered his eyes. ¡°Unchanged, my lady.¡±
   It was the reply she had expected, no more and no less. Her hands throbbed with pain, as if the blade were still in her, cutting deep. She sent the servants away and looked back to Robb. ¡°Do you have the answer yet?¡±
   ¡°Someone is afraid Bran might wake up,¡± Robb said, ¡°afraid of what he might say or do, afraid of something he knows.¡±
   Catelyn was proud of him. ¡°Very good.¡± She turned to the new captain of the guard. ¡°We must keep Bran safe. If there was one killer, there could be others.¡±
   ¡°How many guards do you want, rn¡¯lady?¡± Hal asked.
   ¡°So long as Lord Eddard is away, my son is the master of Winterfell,¡± she told him.
   Robb stood a little taller. ¡°Put one man in the sickroom, night and day, one outside the door, two at the bottom of the stairs. No one sees Bran without my warrant or my mother¡¯s.¡±
   ¡°As you say, m¡¯lord.¡±
   ¡°Do it now,¡± Catelyn suggested.
   ¡°And let his wolf stay in the room with him,¡± Robb added.
   ¡°Yes,¡± Catelyn said. And then again: ¡°Yes.¡±
   Hallis Mollen bowed and left the room.
   ¡°Lady Stark,¡± Ser Rodrik said when the guardsman had gone, ¡°did you chance to notice the dagger the killer used?¡±
   ¡°The circumstances did not allow me to examine it closely, but I can vouch for its edge,¡± Catelyn replied with a dry smile. ¡°Why do you ask?¡±
   ¡°We found the knife still in the villain¡¯s grasp. It seemed to me that it was altogether too fine a weapon for such a man, so I looked at it long and hard. The blade is Valyrian steel, the hilt dragonbone. A weapon like that has no business being in the hands of such as him. Someone gave it to him.¡±
   Catelyn nodded, thoughtful. ¡°Robb, close the door.¡±
   He looked at her strangely, but did as she told him.
   ¡°What I am about to tell you must not leave this room,¡± she told them. ¡°I want your oaths on that. If even part of what I suspect is true, Ned and my girls have ridden into deadly danger, and a word in the wrong ears could mean their lives.¡±
   ¡°Lord Eddard is a second father to me,¡± said Theon Greyjoy. ¡°I do so swear.¡±
   ¡°You have my oath,¡± Maester Luwin said.
   ¡°And mine, my lady,¡± echoed Ser Rodrik.
   She looked at her son. ¡°And you, Robb?¡±
   He nodded his consent.
   ¡°My sister Lysa believes the Lannisters murdered her husband, Lord Arryn, the Hand of the King,¡± Catelyn told them. ¡°It comes to me that Jaime Lannister did not join the hunt the day Bran fell. He remained here in the castle.¡± The room was deathly quiet. ¡°I do not think Bran fell from that tower,¡± she said into the stillness. ¡°I think he was thrown.¡±
   The shock was plain on their faces. ¡°My lady, that is a monstrous suggestion,¡± said Rodrik Cassel. ¡°Even the Kingslayer would flinch at the murder of an innocent child.¡±
   ¡°Oh, would he?¡± Theon Greyjoy asked. ¡°I wonder.¡±
   ¡°There is no limit to Lannister pride or Lannister ambition,¡± Catelyn said.
   ¡°The boy had always been surehanded in the past,¡± Maester Luwin said thoughtfully. ¡°He knew every stone in Winterfell.¡±
   ¡°Gods,¡± Robb swore, his young face dark with anger. ¡°If this is true, he will pay for it.¡± He drew his sword and waved it in the air. ¡°I¡¯ll kill him myself!¡±
   Ser Rodrik bristled at him. ¡°Put that away! The Lannisters are a hundred leagues away. Never draw your sword unless you mean to use it. How many times must I tell you, foolish boy?¡±
   Abashed, Robb sheathed his sword, suddenly a child again. Catelyn said to Ser Rodrik, ¡°I see my son is wearing steel now.¡±
   The old master-at-arms said, ¡°I thought it was time.¡±
   Robb was looking at her anxiously. ¡°Past time,¡± she said. ¡°Winterfell may have need of all its swords soon, and they had best not be made of wood.¡±
   Theon Greyjoy put a hand on the hilt of his blade and said, ¡°My lady, if it comes to that, my House owes yours a great debt.¡±
   Maester Luwin pulled at his chain collar where it chafed against his neck. ¡°All we have is conjecture. This is the queen¡¯s beloved brother we mean to accuse. She will not take it kindly. We must have proof, or forever keep silent.¡±
   ¡°Your proof is in the dagger,¡± Ser Rodrik said. ¡°A fine blade like that will not have gone unnoticed.¡±
   There was only one place to find the truth of it, Catelyn realized. ¡°Someone must go to King¡¯s Landing.¡±
   ¡°I¡¯ll go,¡± Robb said.
   ¡°No,¡± she told him. ¡°Your place is here. There must always be a Stark in Winterfell.¡± She looked at Ser Rodrik with his great white whiskers, at Maester Luwin in his grey robes, at young Greyjoy, lean and dark and impetuous. Who to send? Who would be believed? Then she knew. Catelyn struggled to push back the blankets, her bandaged fingers as stiff and unyielding as stone. She climbed out of bed. ¡°I must go myself.¡±
   ¡°My lady,¡± said Maester Luwin, ¡°is that wise? Surely the Lannisters would greet your arrival with suspicion.¡±
   ¡°What about Bran?¡± Robb asked. The poor boy looked utterly confused now. ¡°You can¡¯t mean to leave him.¡±
   ¡°I have done everything I can for Bran,¡± she said, laying a wounded hand on his arm. ¡°His life is in the hands of the gods and Maester Luwin. As you reminded me yourself, Robb, I have other children to think of now.¡±
   ¡°You will need a strong escort, my lady,¡± Theon said.
   ¡°I¡¯ll send Hal with a squad of guardsmen,¡± Robb said.
   ¡°No,¡± Catelyn said. ¡°A large party attracts unwelcome attention. I would not have the Lannisters know I am coming.¡±
   Ser Rodrik protested. ¡°My lady, let me accompany you at least. The kingsroad can be perilous for a woman alone.¡±
   ¡°I will not be taking the kingsroad,¡± Catelyn replied. She thought for a moment, then nodded her consent. ¡°Two riders can move as fast as one, and a good deal faster than a long column burdened by wagons and wheelhouses. I will welcome your company, Ser Rodrik. We will follow the White Knife down to the sea, and hire a ship at White Harbor. Strong horses and brisk winds should bring us to King¡¯s Landing well ahead of Ned and the Lannisters.¡± And then, she thought, we shall see what we shall see.

   Eddard Stark had left before dawn, Septa Mordane informed Sansa as they broke their fast. ¡°The king sent for him. Another hunt, I do believe. There are still wild aurochs in these lands, I am told.¡±
   ¡°I¡¯ve never seen an aurochs,¡± Sansa said, feeding a piece of bacon to Lady under the table. The direwolf took it from her hand, as delicate as a queen.
   Septa Mordane sniffed in disapproval. ¡°A noble lady does not feed dogs at her table,¡± she said, breaking off another piece of comb and letting the honey drip down onto her bread.
   ¡°She¡¯s not a dog, she¡¯s a direwolf,¡± Sansa pointed out as Lady licked her fingers with a rough tongue. ¡°Anyway, Father said we could keep them with us if we want.¡±
   The septa was not appeased. ¡°You¡¯re a good girl, Sansa, but I do vow, when it comes to that creature you¡¯re as willful as your sister Arya.¡± She scowled. ¡°And where is Arya this morning?¡±
   ¡°She wasn¡¯t hungry,¡± Sansa said, knowing full well that her sister had probably stolen down to the kitchen hours ago and wheedled a breakfast out of some cook¡¯s boy.
   ¡°Do remind her to dress nicely today. The grey velvet, perhaps. We are all invited to ride with the queen and Princess Myrcella in the royal wheelhouse, and we must look our best.¡±
   Sansa already looked her best. She had brushed out her long auburn hair until it shone, and picked her nicest blue silks. She had been looking forward to today for more than a week. It was a great honor to ride with the queen, and besides, Prince Joffrey might be there. Her betrothed. Just thinking it made her feel a strange fluttering inside, even though they were not to marry for years and years. Sansa did not really know Joffrey yet, but she was already in love with him. He was all she ever dreamt her prince should be, tall and handsome and strong, with hair like gold. She treasured every chance to spend time with him, few as they were. The only thing that scared her about today was Arya. Arya had a way of ruining everything. You never knew what she would do. ¡°I¡¯ll tell her,¡± Sansa said uncertainly, ¡°but she¡¯ll dress the way she always does.¡± She hoped it wouldn¡¯t be too embarrassing. ¡°May I be excused?¡±
   ¡°You may.¡± Septa Mordane helped herself to more bread and honey, and Sansa slid from the bench. Lady followed at her heels as she ran from the inn¡¯s common room.
   Outside, she stood for a moment amidst the shouts and curses and the creak of wooden wheels as the men broke down the tents and pavilions and loaded the wagons for another day¡¯s march. The inn was a sprawling three-story structure of pale stone, the biggest that Sansa had ever seen, but even so, it had accommodations for less than a third of the king¡¯s party, which had swollen to more than four hundred with the addition of her father¡¯s household and the freeriders who had joined them on the road.
   She found Arya on the banks of the Trident, trying to hold Nymeria still while she brushed dried mud from her fur. The direwolf was not enjoying the process. Arya was wearing the same riding leathers she had worn yesterday and the day before.
   ¡°You better put on something pretty,¡± Sansa told her. ¡°Septa Mordane said so. We¡¯re traveling in the queen¡¯s wheelhouse with Princess Myrcella today.¡±
   ¡°I¡¯m not,¡± Arya said, trying to brush a tangle out of Nymeria¡¯s matted grey fur. ¡°Mycah and I are going to ride upstream and look for rubies at the ford.¡±
   ¡°Rubies,¡± Sansa said, lost. ¡°What rubies?¡±
   Arya gave her a look like she was so stupid. ¡°Rhaegar¡¯s rubies. This is where King Robert killed him and won the crown.¡±
   Sansa regarded her scrawny little sister in disbelief. ¡°You can¡¯t look for rubies, the princess is expecting us. The queen invited us both.¡±
   ¡°I don¡¯t care,¡± Arya said. ¡°The wheelhouse doesn¡¯t even have windows, you can¡¯t see a thing.¡±
   ¡°What could you want to see?¡± Sansa said, annoyed. She had been thrilled by the invitation, and her stupid sister was going to ruin everything, just as she¡¯d feared. ¡°It¡¯s all just fields and farms and holdfasts.¡±
   ¡°It is not,¡± Arya said stubbornly. ¡°If you came with us sometimes, you¡¯d see.¡±
   ¡°I hate riding,¡± Sansa said fervently. ¡°All it does is get you soiled and dusty and sore.¡±
   Arya shrugged. ¡°Hold still,¡± she snapped at Nymeria, ¡°I¡¯m not hurting you.¡± Then to Sansa she said, ¡°When we were crossing the Neck, I counted thirty-six flowers I never saw before, and Mycah showed me a lizard-lion.¡±
   Sansa shuddered. They had been twelve days crossing the Neck, rumbling down a crooked causeway through an endless black bog, and she had hated every moment of it. The air had been damp and clammy, the causeway so narrow they could not even make proper camp at night, they had to stop right on the kingsroad. Dense thickets of half-drowned trees pressed close around them, branches dripping with curtains of pale fungus. Huge flowers bloomed in the mud and floated on pools of stagnant water, but if you were stupid enough to leave the causeway to pluck them, there were quicksands waiting to suck you down, and snakes watching from the trees, and lizard lions floating half-submerged in the water, like black logs with eyes and teeth.
   None of which stopped Arya, of course. One day she came back grinning her horsey grin, her hair all tangled and her clothes covered in mud, clutching a raggedy bunch of purple and green flowers for Father. Sansa kept hoping he would tell Arya to behave herself and act like the highborn lady she was supposed to be, but he never did, he only hugged her and thanked her for the flowers. That just made her worse.
   Then it turned out the purple flowers were called poison kisses, and Arya got a rash on her arms. Sansa would have thought that might have taught her a lesson, but Arya laughed about it, and the next day she rubbed mud all over her arms like some ignorant bog woman just because her friend Mycah told her it would stop the itching. She had bruises on her arms and shoulders too, dark purple welts and faded green-and-yellow splotches, Sansa had seen them when her sister undressed for sleep. How she had gotten those only the seven gods knew.
   Arya was still going on, brushing out Nymeria¡¯s tangles and chattering about things she¡¯d seen on the trek south. ¡°Last week we found this haunted watchtower, and the day before we chased a herd of wild horses. You should have seen them run when they caught a scent of Nymeria.¡± The wolf wriggled in her grasp and Arya scolded her. ¡°Stop that, I have to do the other side, you¡¯re all muddy.¡±
   ¡°You¡¯re not supposed to leave the column,¡± Sansa reminded her. ¡°Father said so.¡±
   Arya shrugged. ¡°I didn¡¯t go far. Anyway, Nymeria was with me the whole time. I don¡¯t always go off, either. Sometimes it¡¯s fun just to ride along with the wagons and talk to people.¡±
   Sansa knew all about the sorts of people Arya liked to talk to: squires and grooms and serving girls, old men and naked children, rough-spoken freeriders of uncertain birth. Arya would make friends with anybody. This Mycah was the worst; a butcher¡¯s boy, thirteen and wild, he slept in the meat wagon and smelled of the slaughtering block. Just the sight of him was enough to make Sansa feel sick, but Arya seemed to prefer his company to hers.
   Sansa was running out of patience now. ¡°You have to come with me,¡± she told her sister firmly. ¡°You can¡¯t refuse the queen. Septa Mordane will expect you.¡±
   Arya ignored her. She gave a hard yank with the brush. Nymeria growled and spun away, affronted. ¡°Come back here!¡±
   ¡°There¡¯s going to be lemon cakes and tea,¡± Sansa went on, all adult and reasonable. Lady brushed against her leg. Sansa scratched her ears the way she liked, and Lady sat beside her on her haunches, watching Arya chase Nymeria. ¡°Why would you want to ride a smelly old horse and get all sore and sweaty when you could recline on feather pillows and eat cakes with the queen?¡±
   ¡°I don¡¯t like the queen,¡± Arya said casually. Sansa sucked in her breath, shocked that even Arya would say such a thing, but her sister prattled on, heedless. ¡°She won¡¯t even let me bring Nymeria.¡± She thrust the brush under her belt and stalked her wolf. Nymeria watched her approach warily.
   ¡°A royal wheelhouse is no place for a wolf,¡± Sansa said. ¡°And Princess Myrcella is afraid of them, you know that.¡±
   ¡°Myrcella is a little baby.¡± Arya grabbed Nymeria around her neck, but the moment she pulled out the brush again the direwolf wriggled free and bounded off. Frustrated, Arya threw down the brush. ¡°Bad wolf!¡± she shouted.
   Sansa couldn¡¯t help but smile a little. The kennelmaster once told her that an animal takes after its master. She gave Lady a quick little hug. Lady licked her cheek. Sansa giggled. Arya heard and whirled around, glaring. ¡°I don¡¯t care what you say, I¡¯m going out riding.¡± Her long horsey face got the stubborn look that meant she was going to do something willful.
   ¡°Gods be true, Arya, sometimes you act like such a child,¡± Sansa said. ¡°I¡¯ll go by myself then. It will be ever so much nicer that way. Lady and I will eat all the lemon cakes and just have the best time without you.¡±
   She turned to walk off, but Arya shouted after her, ¡°They won¡¯t let you bring Lady either.¡± She was gone before Sansa could think of a reply, chasing Nymeria along the river.
   Alone and humiliated, Sansa took the long way back to the inn, where she knew Septa Mordane would be waiting. Lady padded quietly by her side. She was almost in tears. All she wanted was for things to be nice and pretty, the way they were in the songs. Why couldn¡¯t Arya be sweet and delicate and kind, like Princess Myrcella? She would have liked a sister like that.
   Sansa could never understand how two sisters, born only two years apart, could be so different. It would have been easier if Arya had been a bastard, like their half brother Jon. She even looked like Jon, with the long face and brown hair of the Starks, and nothing of their lady mother in her face or her coloring. And Jon¡¯s mother had been common, or so people whispered. Once, when she was littler, Sansa had even asked Mother if perhaps there hadn¡¯t been some mistake. Perhaps the grumkins had stolen her real sister. But Mother had only laughed and said no, Arya was her daughter and Sansa¡¯s trueborn sister, blood of their blood. Sansa could not think why Mother would want to lie about it, so she supposed it had to be true.
   As she neared the center of camp, her distress was quickly forgotten. A crowd had gathered around the queen¡¯s wheelhouse. Sansa heard excited voices buzzing like a hive of bees. The doors had been thrown open, she saw, and the queen stood at the top of the wooden steps, smiling down at someone. She heard her saying, ¡°The council does us great honor, my good lords.¡±
   ¡°What¡¯s happening?¡± she asked a squire she knew.
   ¡°The council sent riders from King¡¯s Landing to escort us the rest of the way,¡± he told her. ¡°An honor guard for the king.¡±
   Anxious to see, Sansa let Lady clear a path through the crowd. People moved aside hastily for the direwolf. When she got closer, she saw two knights kneeling before the queen, in armor so fine and gorgeous that it made her blink.
   One knight wore an intricate suit of white enameled scales, brilliant as a field of new-fallen snow, with silver chasings and clasps that glittered in the sun. When he removed his helm, Sansa saw that he was an old man with hair as pale as his armor, yet he seemed strong and graceful for all that. From his shoulders hung the pure white cloak of the Kingsguard.
   His companion was a man near twenty whose armor was steel plate of a deep forest-green. He was the handsomest man Sansa had ever set eyes upon; tall and powerfully made, with jet-black hair that fell to his shoulders and framed a clean-shaven face, and laughing green eyes to match his armor. Cradled under one arm was an antlered helm, its magnificent rack shimmering in gold.
   At first Sansa did not notice the third stranger. He did not kneel with the others. He stood to one side, beside their horses, a gaunt grim man who watched the proceedings in silence. His face was pockmarked and beardless, with deepset eyes and hollow cheeks. Though he was not an old man, only a few wisps of hair remained to him, sprouting above his ears, but those he had grown long as a woman¡¯s. His armor was iron-grey chainmail over layers of boiled leather, plain and unadorned, and it spoke of age and hard use. Above his right shoulder the stained leather hilt of the blade strapped to his back was visible; a two-handed greatsword, too long to be worn at his side.
   ¡°The king is gone hunting, but I know he will be pleased to see you when he returns,¡± the queen was saying to the two knights who knelt before her, but Sansa could not take her eyes off the third man. He seemed to feel the weight of her gaze. Slowly he turned his head. Lady growled. A terror as overwhelming as anything Sansa Stark had ever felt filled her suddenly. She stepped backward and bumped into someone.
   Strong hands grasped her by the shoulders, and for a moment Sansa thought it was her father, but when she turned, it was the burned face of Sandor Clegane looking down at her, his mouth twisted in a terrible mockery of a smile. ¡°You are shaking, girl,¡± he said, his voice rasping. ¡°Do I frighten you so much?¡±
   He did, and had since she had first laid eyes on the ruin that fire had made of his face, though it seemed to her now that he was not half so terrifying as the other. Still, Sansa wrenched away from him, and the Hound laughed, and Lady moved between them, rumbling a warning. Sansa dropped to her knees to wrap her arms around the wolf. They were all gathered around gaping, she could feel their eyes on her, and here and there she heard muttered comments and titters of laughter.
   ¡°A wolf,¡± a man said, and someone else said, ¡°Seven hells, that¡¯s a direwolf,¡± and the first man said, ¡°What¡¯s it doing in camp?¡± and the Hound¡¯s rasping voice replied, ¡°The Starks use them for wet nurses,¡± and Sansa realized that the two stranger knights were looking down on her and Lady, swords in their hands, and then she was frightened again, and ashamed. Tears filled her eyes.
   She heard the queen say, ¡°Joffrey, go to her.¡±
   And her prince was there.
   ¡°Leave her alone,¡± Joffrey said. He stood over her, beautiful in blue wool and black leather, his golden curls shining in the sun like a crown. He gave her his hand, drew her to her feet. ¡°What is it, sweet lady? Why are you afraid? No one will hurt you. Put away your swords, all of you. The wolf is her little pet, that¡¯s all.¡± He looked at Sandor Clegane. ¡°And you, dog, away with you, you¡¯re scaring my betrothed.¡±
   The Hound, ever faithful, bowed and slid away quietly through the press. Sansa struggled to steady herself. She felt like such a fool. She was a Stark of Winterfell, a noble lady, and someday she would be a queen. ¡°It was not him, my sweet prince,¡± she tried to explain. ¡°It was the other one.¡±
   The two stranger knights exchanged a look. ¡°Payne?¡± chuckled the young man in the green armor.
   The older man in white spoke to Sansa gently. ¡°Ofttimes Ser Ilyn frightens me as well, sweet lady. He has a fearsome aspect.¡±
   ¡°As well he should.¡± The queen had descended from the wheelhouse. The spectators parted to make way for her. ¡°If the wicked do not fear the Mng¡¯s Justice, you have put the wrong man in the office.¡±
   Sansa finally found her words. ¡°Then surely you have chosen the right one, Your Grace,¡± she said, and a gale of laughter erupted all around her.
   ¡°Well spoken, child,¡± said the old man in white. ¡°As befits the daughter of Eddard Stark. I am honored to know you, however irregular the manner of our meeting. I am Ser Barristan Selmy, of the Kingsguard.¡± He bowed.
   Sansa knew the name, and now the courtesies that Septa Mordane had taught her over the years came back to her. ¡°The Lord Commander of the Kingsguard,¡± she said, ¡°and councillor to Robert our king and to Aerys Targaryen before him. The honor is mine, good knight. Even in the far north, the singers praise the deeds of Barristan the Bold.¡±
   The green knight laughed again. ¡°Barristan the Old, you mean. Don¡¯t flatter him too sweetly, child, he thinks overmuch of himself already.¡± He smiled at her. ¡°Now, wolf girl, if you can put a name to me as well, then I must concede that you are truly our Hand¡¯s daughter.¡±
   Joffrey stiffened beside her. ¡°Have a care how you address my betrothed.¡±
   ¡°I can answer,¡± Sansa said quickly, to quell her prince¡¯s anger. She smiled at the green knight. ¡°Your helmet bears golden antlers, my lord. The stag is the sigil of the royal House. King Robert has two brothers. By your extreme youth, you can only be Renly Baratheon, Lord of Storm¡¯s End and councillor to the king, and so I name you.¡±
   Ser Barristan chuckled. ¡°By his extreme youth, he can only be a prancing jackanapes, and so I name him.¡±
   There was general laughter, led by Lord Renly himself. The tension of a few moments ago was gone, and Sansa was beginning to feel comfortable?.?.?.?until Ser Ilyn Payne shouldered two men aside, and stood before her, unsmiling. He did not say a word. Lady bared her teeth and began to growl, a low rumble full of menace, but this time Sansa silenced the wolf with a gentle hand to the head. ¡°I am sorry if I offended you, Ser Ilyn,¡± she said.
   She waited for an answer, but none came. As the headsman looked at her, his pale colorless eyes seemed to strip the clothes away from her, and then the skin, leaving her soul naked before him. Still silent, he turned and walked away.
   Sansa did not understand. She looked at her prince. ¡°Did I say something wrong, Your Grace? Why will he not speak to me?¡±
   ¡°Ser Ilyn has not been feeling talkative these past fourteen years,¡± Lord Renly commented with a sly smile.
   Joffrey gave his uncle a look of pure loathing, then took Sansa¡¯s hands in his own. ¡°Aerys Targaryen had his tongue ripped out with hot pincers.¡±
   ¡°He speaks most eloquently with his sword, however,¡± the queen said, ¡°and his devotion to our realm is unquestioned.¡± Then she smiled graciously and said, ¡°Sansa, the good councillors and I must speak together until the king returns with your father. I fear we shall have to postpone your day with Myrcella. Please give your sweet sister my apologies. Joffrey, perhaps you would be so kind as to entertain our guest today.¡±
   ¡°It would be my pleasure, Mother,¡± Joffrey said very formally. He took her by the arm and led her away from the wheelhouse, and Sansa¡¯s spirits took flight. A whole day with her prince! She gazed at Joffrey worshipfully. He was so gallant, she thought. The way he had rescued her from Ser Ilyn and the Hound, why, it was almost like the songs, like the time Serwyn of the Mirror Shield saved the Princess Daeryssa from the giants, or Prince Aemon the Dragonknight championing Queen Naerys¡¯s honor against evil Ser Morgil¡¯s slanders.
   The touch of Joffrey¡¯s hand on her sleeve made her heart beat faster. ¡°What would you like to do?¡±
   Be with you, Sansa thought, but she said, ¡°Whatever you¡¯d like to do, my prince.¡±
   Jofftey reflected a moment. ¡°We could go riding.¡±
   ¡°Oh, I love riding,¡± Sansa said.
   Joffrey glanced back at Lady, who was following at their heels. ¡°Your wolf is liable to frighten the horses, and my dog seems to frighten you. Let us leave them both behind and set off on our own, what do you say?¡±
   Sansa hesitated. ¡°If you like,¡± she said uncertainly. ¡°I suppose I could tie Lady up.¡± She did not quite understand, though. ¡°I didn¡¯t know you had a dog?.?.?.?¡±
   Joffrey laughed. ¡°He¡¯s my mother¡¯s dog, in truth. She has set him to guard me, and so he does.¡±
   ¡°You mean the Hound,¡± she said. She wanted to hit herself for being so slow. Her prince would never love her if she seemed stupid. ¡°Is it safe to leave him behind?¡±
   Prince Joffrey looked annoyed that she would even ask. ¡°Have no fear, lady. I am almost a man grown, and I don¡¯t fight with wood like your brothers. All I need is this.¡± He drew his sword and showed it to her; a longsword adroitly shrunken to suit a boy of twelve, gleaming blue steel, castle-forged and double-edged, with a leather grip and a lion¡¯s-head pommel in gold. Sansa exclaimed over it admiringly, and Joffrey looked pleased. ¡°I call it Lion¡¯s Tooth,¡± he said.
   And so they left her direwolf and his bodyguard behind them, while they ranged east along the north bank of the Trident with no company save Lion¡¯s Tooth.
   It was a glorious day, a magical day. The air was warm and heavy with the scent of flowers, and the woods here had a gentle beauty that Sansa had never seen in the north. Prince Joffrey¡¯s mount was a blood bay courser, swift as the wind, and he rode it with reckless abandon, so fast that Sansa was hard-pressed to keep up on her mare. It was a day for adventures. They explored the caves by the riverbank, and tracked a shadowcat to its lair, and when they grew hungry, Joffrey found a holdfast by its smoke and told them to fetch food and wine for their prince and his lady. They dined on trout fresh from the river, and Sansa drank more wine than she had ever drunk before. ¡°My father only lets us have one cup, and only at feasts,¡± she confessed to her prince.
   ¡°My betrothed can drink as much as she wants,¡± Joffrey said, refilling her cup.
   They went more slowly after they had eaten. Joffrey sang for her as they rode, his voice high and sweet and pure. Sansa was a little dizzy from the wine. ¡°Shouldn¡¯t we be starting back?¡± she asked.
   ¡°Soon,¡± Joffrey said. ¡°The battleground is right up ahead, where the river bends. That was where my father killed Rhaegar Targaryen, you know. He smashed in his chest, crunch, right through the armor.¡± Joffrey swung an imaginary warhammer to show her how it was done. ¡°Then my uncle Jaime killed old Aerys, and my father was king. What¡¯s that sound?¡±
   Sansa heard it too, floating through the woods, a kind of wooden clattering, snack snack snack. ¡°I don¡¯t know,¡± she said. It made her nervous, though. ¡°Joffrey, let¡¯s go back.¡±
   ¡°I want to see what it is.¡± Joffrey turned his horse in the direction of the sounds, and Sansa had no choice but to follow. The noises grew louder and more distinct, the clack of wood on wood, and as they grew closer they heard heavy breathing as well, and now and then a grunt.
   ¡°Someone¡¯s there,¡± Sansa said anxiously. She found herself thinking of Lady, wishing the direwolf was with her.
   ¡°You¡¯re safe with me.¡± Joffrey drew his Lion¡¯s Tooth from its sheath. The sound of steel on leather made her tremble. ¡°This way,¡± he said, riding through a stand of trees.
   Beyond, in a clearing overlooking the river, they came upon a boy and a girl playing at knights. Their swords were wooden sticks, broom handles from the look of them, and they were rushing across the grass, swinging at each other lustily. The boy was years older, a head taller, and much stronger, and he was pressing the attack. The girl, a scrawny thing in soiled leathers, was dodging and managing to get her stick in the way of most of the boy¡¯s blows, but not all. When she tried to lunge at him, he caught her stick with his own, swept it aside, and slid his wood down hard on her fingers. She cried out and lost her weapon.
   Prince Joffrey laughed. The boy looked around, wide-eyed and startled, and dropped his stick in the grass. The girl glared at them, sucking on her knuckles to take the sting out, and Sansa was horrified. ¡°Arya?¡± she called out incredulously.
   ¡°Go away,¡± Arya shouted back at them, angry tears in her eyes. ¡°What are you doing here? Leave us alone.¡±
   Joffrey glanced from Arya to Sansa and back again. ¡°Your sister?¡± She nodded, blushing. Joffrey examined the boy, an ungainly lad with a coarse, freckled face and thick red hair. ¡°And who are you, boy?¡± he asked in a commanding tone that took no notice of the fact that the other was a year his senior.
   ¡°Mycah,¡± the boy muttered. He recognized the prince and averted his eyes. ¡°M¡¯lord.¡±
   ¡°He¡¯s the butcher¡¯s boy,¡± Sansa said.
   ¡°He¡¯s my friend,¡± Arya said sharply. ¡°You leave him alone.¡±
   ¡°A butcher¡¯s boy who wants to be a knight, is it?¡± Joffrey swung down from his mount, sword in hand. ¡°Pick up your sword, butcher¡¯s boy,¡± he said, his eyes bright with amusement. ¡°Let us see how good you are.¡±
   Mycah stood there, frozen with fear.
   Joffrey walked toward him. ¡°Go on, pick it up. Or do you only fight little girls?¡±
   ¡°She ast me to, m¡¯lord,¡± Mycah said. ¡°She ast me to.¡±
   Sansa had only to glance at Arya and see the flush on her sister¡¯s face to know the boy was telling the truth, but Joffrey was in no mood to listen. The wine had made him wild. ¡°Are you going to pick up your sword?¡±
   Mycah shook his head. ¡°It¡¯s only a stick, m¡¯lord. It¡¯s not no sword, it¡¯s only a stick.¡±
   ¡°And you¡¯re only a butcher¡¯s boy, and no knight.¡± Joffrey lifted Lion¡¯s Tooth and laid its point on Mycah¡¯s cheek below the eye, as the butcher¡¯s boy stood trembling. ¡°That was my lady¡¯s sister you were hitting, do you know that?¡± A bright bud of blood blossomed where his sword pressed into Mycah¡¯s flesh, and a slow red line trickled down the boy¡¯s cheek.
   ¡°Stop it!¡± Arya screamed. She grabbed up her fallen stick.
   Sansa was afraid. ¡°Arya, you stay out of this.¡±
   ¡°I won¡¯t hurt him?.?.?.?much,¡± Prince Joffrey told Arya, never taking his eyes off the butcher¡¯s boy.
   Arya went for him.
   Sansa slid off her mare, but she was too slow. Arya swung with both hands. There was a loud crack as the wood split against the back of the prince¡¯s head, and then everything happened at once before Sansa¡¯s horrified eyes. Joffrey staggered and whirled around, roaring curses. Mycah ran for the trees as fast as his legs would take him. Arya swung at the prince again, but this time Joffrey caught the blow on Lion¡¯s Tooth and sent her broken stick flying from her hands. The back of his head was all bloody and his eyes were on fire. Sansa was shrieking, ¡°No, no, stop it, stop it, both of you, you¡¯re spoiling it,¡± but no one was listening. Arya scooped up a rock and hurled it at Joffrey¡¯s head. She hit his horse instead, and the blood bay reared and went galloping off after Mycah. ¡°Stop it, don¡¯t, stop it!¡± Sansa screamed. Joffrey slashed at Arya with his sword, screaming obscenities, terrible words, filthy words. Arya darted back, frightened now, but Joffrey followed, hounding her toward the woods, backing her up against a tree. Sansa didn¡¯t know what to do. She watched helplessly, almost blind from her tears.
   Then a grey blur flashed past her, and suddenly Nymeria was there, leaping, jaws closing around Joffrey¡¯s sword arm. The steel fell from his fingers as the wolf knocked him off his feet, and they rolled in the grass, the wolf snarling and ripping at him, the prince shrieking in pain. ¡°Get it off,¡± he screamed. ¡°Get it off!¡±
   Arya¡¯s voice cracked like a whip. ¡°Nymeria!¡±
   The direwolf let go of Joffrey and moved to Arya¡¯s side. The prince lay in the grass, whimpering, cradling his mangled arm. His shirt was soaked in blood. Arya said, ¡°She didn¡¯t hurt you?.?.?.?much.¡± She picked up Lion¡¯s Tooth where it had fallen, and stood over him, holding the sword with both hands.
   Jofftey made a scared whimpery sound as he looked up at her. ¡°No,¡± he said, ¡°don¡¯t hurt me. I¡¯ll tell my mother.¡±
   ¡°You leave him alone!¡± Sansa screamed at her sister.
   Arya whirled and heaved the sword into the air, putting her whole body into the throw. The blue steel flashed in the sun as the sword spun out over the river. It hit the water and vanished with a splash. Joffrey moaned. Arya ran off to her horse, Nymeria loping at her heels.
   After they had gone, Sansa went to Prince Joffrey. His eyes were closed in pain, his breath ragged. Sansa knelt beside him. ¡°Joffrey,¡± she sobbed. ¡°Oh, look what they did, look what they did. My poor prince. Don¡¯t be afraid. I¡¯ll ride to the holdfast and bring help for you.¡± Tenderly she reached out and brushed back his soft blond hair.
   His eyes snapped open and looked at her, and there was nothing but loathing there, nothing but the vilest contempt. ¡°Then go,¡± he spit at her. ¡°And don¡¯t touch me.¡±
   
   16£®EDDARD
   ¡°They¡¯ve found her, my lord.¡±
   Ned rose quickly. ¡°Our men or Lannister¡¯s?¡±
   ¡°It was Jory,¡± his steward Vayon Poole replied. ¡°She¡¯s not been harmed.¡±
   ¡°Thank the gods,¡± Ned said. His men had been searching for Arya for four days now, but the queen¡¯s men had been out hunting as well. ¡°Where is she? Tell Jory to bring her here at once.¡±
   ¡°I am sorry, my lord,¡± Poole told him. ¡°The guards on the gate were Lannister men, and they informed the queen when Jory brought her in. She¡¯s being taken directly before the king?.?.?.?¡±
   ¡°Damn that woman!¡± Ned said, striding to the door. ¡°Find Sansa and bring her to the audience chamber. Her voice may be needed.¡± He descended the tower steps in a red rage. He had led searches himself for the first three days, and had scarcely slept an hour since Arya had disappeared. This morning he had been so heartsick and weary he could scarcely stand, but now his fury was on him, filling him with strength.
   Men called out to him as he crossed the castle yard, but Ned ignored them in his haste. He would have run, but he was still the King¡¯s Hand, and a Hand must keep his dignity. He was aware of the eyes that followed him, of the muttered voices wondering what he would do.
   The castle was a modest holding a half day¡¯s ride south of the Trident. The royal party had made themselves the uninvited guests of its lord, Ser Raymun Darry, while the hunt for Arya and the butcher¡¯s boy was conducted on both sides of the river. They were not welcome visitors. Ser Raymun lived under the king¡¯s peace, but his family had fought beneath Rhaegar¡¯s dragon banners at the Trident, and his three older brothers had died there, a truth neither Robert nor Ser Raymun had forgotten. With king¡¯s men, Darry men, Lannister men, and Stark men all crammed into a castle far too small for them, tensions burned hot and heavy.
   The king had appropriated Ser Raymun¡¯s audience chamber, and that was where Ned found them. The room was crowded when he burst in. Too crowded, he thought; left alone, he and Robert might have been able to settle the matter amicably.
   Robert was slumped in Darry¡¯s high seat at the far end of the room, his face closed and sullen. Cersei Lannister and her son stood beside him. The queen had her hand on Joffrey¡¯s shoulder. Thick silken bandages still covered the boy¡¯s arm.
   Arya stood in the center of the room, alone but for Jory Cassel, every eye upon her. ¡°Arya,¡± Ned called loudly. He went to her, his boots ringing on the stone floor. When she saw him, she cried out and began to sob.
   Ned went to one knee and took her in his arms. She was shaking. ¡°I¡¯m sorry,¡± she sobbed, ¡°I¡¯m sorry, I¡¯m sorry.¡±
   ¡°I know,¡± he said. She felt so tiny in his arms, nothing but a scrawny little girl. It was hard to see how she had caused so much trouble. ¡°Are you hurt?¡±
   ¡°No.¡± Her face was dirty, and her tears left pink tracks down her cheeks. ¡°Hungry some. I ate some berries, but there was nothing else.¡±
   ¡°We¡¯ll feed you soon enough,¡± Ned promised. He rose to face the king. ¡°What is the meaning of this?¡± His eyes swept the room, searching for friendly faces. But for his own men, they were few enough. Ser Raymun Darry guarded his look well. Lord Renly wore a half smile that might mean anything, and old Ser Barristan was grave; the rest were Lannister men, and hostile. Their only good fortune was that both Jaime Lannister and Sandor Clegane were missing, leading searches north of the Trident. ¡°Why was I not told that my daughter had been found?¡± Ned demanded, his voice ringing. ¡°Why was she not brought to me at once?¡±
   He spoke to Robert, but it was Cersei Lannister who answered. ¡°How dare you speak to your king in that manner!¡±
   At that, the king stirred. ¡°Quiet, woman,¡± he snapped. He straightened in his seat. ¡°I am sorry, Ned. I never meant to frighten the girl. It seemed best to bring her here and get the business done with quickly.¡±
   ¡°And what business is that?¡± Ned put ice in his voice.
   The queen stepped forward. ¡°You know full well, Stark. This girl of yours attacked my son. Her and her butcher¡¯s boy. That animal of hers tried to tear his arm off.¡±
   ¡°That¡¯s not true,¡± Arya said loudly. ¡°She just bit him a little. He was hurting Mycah.¡±
   ¡°Joff told us what happened,¡± the queen said. ¡°You and the butcher boy beat him with clubs while you set your wolf on him.¡±
   ¡°That¡¯s not how it was,¡± Arya said, close to tears again. Ned put a hand on her shoulder.
   ¡°Yes it is!¡± Prince Joffrey insisted. ¡°They all attacked me, and she threw Lion¡¯s Tooth in the river!¡± Ned noticed that he did not so much as glance at Arya as he spoke.
   ¡°Liar!¡± Arya yelled.
   ¡°Shut up!¡± the prince yelled back.
   ¡°Enough!¡± the king roared, rising from his seat, his voice thick with irritation. Silence fell. He glowered at Arya through his thick beard. ¡°Now, child, you will tell me what happened. Tell it all, and tell it true. It is a great crime to lie to a king.¡± Then he looked over at his son. ¡°When she is done, you will have your turn. Until then, hold your tongue.¡±
   As Arya began her story, Ned heard the door open behind him. He glanced back and saw Vayon Poole enter with Sansa. They stood quietly at the back of the hall as Arya spoke. When she got to the part where she threw Joffrey¡¯s sword into the middle of the Trident, Renly Baratheon began to laugh. The king bristled. ¡°Ser Barristan, escort my brother from the hall before he chokes.¡±
   Lord Renly stifled his laughter. ¡°My brother is too kind. I can find the door myself.¡± He bowed to Joffrey. ¡°Perchance later you¡¯ll tell me how a nine-year-old girl the size of a wet rat managed to disarm you with a broom handle and throw your sword in the river.¡± As the door swung shut behind him, Ned heard him say, ¡°Lion¡¯s Tooth,¡± and guffaw once more.
   Prince Joffrey was pale as he began his very different version of events. When his son was done talking, the king rose heavily from his seat, looking like a man who wanted to be anywhere but here. ¡°What in all the seven hells am I supposed to make of this? He says one thing, she says another.¡±
   ¡°They were not the only ones present,¡± Ned said. ¡°Sansa, come here.¡± Ned had heard her version of the story the night Arya had vanished. He knew the truth. ¡°Tell us what happened.¡±
   His eldest daughter stepped forward hesitantly. She was dressed in blue velvets trimmed with white, a silver chain around her neck. Her thick auburn hair had been brushed until it shone. She blinked at her sister, then at the young prince. ¡°I don¡¯t know,¡± she said tearfully, looking as though she wanted to bolt. ¡°I don¡¯t remember. Everything happened so fast, I didn¡¯t see?.?.?.?¡±
   ¡°You rotten!¡± Arya shrieked. She flew at her sister like an arrow, knocking Sansa down to the ground, pummeling her. ¡°Liar, liar, liar, liar.¡±
   ¡°Arya, stop it!¡± Ned shouted. Jory pulled her off her sister, kicking. Sansa was pale and shaking as Ned lifted her back to her feet. ¡°Are you hurt?¡± he asked, but she was staring at Arya, and she did not seem to hear.
   ¡°The girl is as wild as that filthy animal of hers,¡± Cersei Lannister said. ¡°Robert, I want her punished.¡±
   ¡°Seven hells,¡± Robert swore. ¡°Cersei, look at her. She¡¯s a child. What would you have me do, whip her through the streets? Damn it, children fight. It¡¯s over. No lasting harm was done.¡±
   The queen was furious. ¡°Joff will carry those scars for the rest of his life.¡±
   Robert Baratheon looked at his eldest son. ¡°So he will. Perhaps they will teach him a lesson. Ned, see that your daughter is disciplined. I will do the same with my son.¡±
   ¡°Gladly, Your Grace,¡± Ned said with vast relief.
   Robert started to walk away, but the queen was not done. ¡°And what of the direwolf?¡± she called after him. ¡°What of the beast that savaged your son?¡±
   The king stopped, turned back, frowned. ¡°I¡¯d forgotten about the damned wolf.¡±
   Ned could see Arya tense in Jory¡¯s arms. Jory spoke up quickly. ¡°We found no trace of the direwolf, Your Grace.¡±
   Robert did not look unhappy. ¡°No? So be it.¡±
   The queen raised her voice. ¡°A hundred golden dragons to the man who brings me its skin!¡±
   ¡°A costly pelt,¡± Robert grumbled. ¡°I want no part of this, woman. You can damn well buy your furs with Lannister gold.¡±
   The queen regarded him coolly. ¡°I had not thought you so niggardly. The king I¡¯d thought to wed would have laid a wolfskin across my bed before the sun went down.¡±
   Robert¡¯s face darkened with anger. ¡°That would be a fine trick, without a wolf.¡±
   ¡°We have a wolf,¡± Cersei Lannister said. Her voice was very quiet, but her green eyes shone with triumph.
   It took them all a moment to comprehend her words, but when they did, the king shrugged irritably. ¡°As you will. Have Ser Ilyn see to it.¡±
   ¡°Robert, you cannot mean this,¡± Ned protested.
   The king was in no mood for more argument. ¡°Enough, Ned, I will hear no more. A direwolf is a savage beast. Sooner or later it would have turned on your girl the same way the other did on my son. Get her a dog, she¡¯ll be happier for it.¡±
   That was when Sansa finally seemed to comprehend. Her eyes were frightened as they went to her father. ¡°He doesn¡¯t mean Lady, does he?¡± She saw the truth on his face. ¡°No,¡± she said. ¡°No, not Lady, Lady didn¡¯t bite anybody, she¡¯s good?.?.?.?¡±
   ¡°Lady wasn¡¯t there,¡± Arya shouted angrily. ¡°You leave her alone!¡±
   ¡°Stop them,¡± Sansa pleaded, ¡°don¡¯t let them do it, please, please, it wasn¡¯t Lady, it was Nymeria, Arya did it, you can¡¯t, it wasn¡¯t Lady, don¡¯t let them hurt Lady, I¡¯ll make her be good, I promise, I promise?.?.?.?¡± She started to cry.
   All Ned could do was take her in his arms and hold her while she wept. He looked across the room at Robert. His old friend, closer than any brother. ¡°Please, Robert. For the love you bear me. For the love you bore my sister. Please.¡±
   The king looked at them for a long moment, then turned his eyes on his wife. ¡°Damn you, Cersei,¡± he said with loathing.
   Ned stood, gently disengaging himself from Sansa¡¯s grasp. All the weariness of the past four days had returned to him. ¡°Do it yourself then, Robert,¡± he said in a voice cold and sharp as steel. ¡°At least have the courage to do it yourself.¡±
   Robert looked at Ned with flat, dead eyes and left without a word, his footsteps heavy as lead. Silence filled the hall.
   ¡°Where is the direwolf?¡± Cersei Lannister asked when her husband was gone. Beside her, Prince Joffrey was smiling.
   ¡°The beast is chained up outside the gatehouse, Your Grace,¡± Ser Barristan Selmy answered reluctantly.
   ¡°Send for Ilyn Payne.¡±
   ¡°No,¡± Ned said. ¡°Jory, take the girls back to their rooms and bring me Ice.¡± The words tasted of bile in his throat, but he forced them out. ¡°If it must be done, I will do it.¡±
   Cersei Lannister regarded him suspiciously. ¡°You, Stark? Is this some trick? Why would you do such a thing?¡±
   They were all staring at him, but it was Sansa¡¯s look that cut. ¡°She is of the north. She deserves better than a butcher.¡±
   He left the room with his eyes burning and his daughter¡¯s wails echoing in his ears, and found the direwolf pup where they chained her. Ned sat beside her for a while. ¡°Lady,¡± he said, tasting the name. He had never paid much attention to the names the children had picked, but looking at her now, he knew that Sansa had chosen well. She was the smallest of the litter, the prettiest, the most gentle and trusting. She looked at him with bright golden eyes, and he ruffled her thick grey fur.
   Shortly, Jory brought him Ice.
   When it was over, he said, ¡°Choose four men and have them take the body north. Bury her at Winterfell.¡±
   ¡°All that way?¡± Jory said, astonished.
   ¡°All that way,¡± Ned affirmed. ¡°The Lannister woman shall never have this skin.¡±
   He was walking back to the tower to give himself up to sleep at last when Sandor Clegane and his riders came pounding through the castle gate, back from their hunt.
   There was something slung over the back of his destrier, a heavy shape wrapped in a bloody cloak. ¡°No sign of your daughter, Hand,¡± the Hound rasped down, ¡°but the day was not wholly wasted. We got her little pet.¡± He reached back and shoved the burden off, and it fell with a thump in front of Ned.
   Bending, Ned pulled back the cloak, dreading the words he would have to find for Arya, but it was not Nymeria after all. It was the butcher¡¯s boy, Mycah, his body covered in dried blood. He had been cut almost in half from shoulder to waist by some terrible blow struck from above.
   ¡°You rode him down,¡± Ned said.
   The Hound¡¯s eyes seemed to glitter through the steel of that hideous dog¡¯s-head helm. ¡°He ran.¡± He looked at Ned¡¯s face and laughed. ¡°But not very fast.¡±
   
   17£®BRAN
   It seemed as though he had been falling for years.
   Fly, a voice whispered in the darkness, but Bran did not know how to fly, so all he could do was fall.
   Maester Luwin made a little boy of clay, baked him till he was hard and brittle, dressed him in Bran¡¯s clothes, and flung him off a roof. Bran remembered the way he shattered. ¡°But I never fall,¡± he said, falling.
   The ground was so far below him he could barely make it out through the grey mists that whirled around him, but he could feel how fast he was falling, and he knew what was waiting for him down there. Even in dreams, you could not fall forever. He would wake up in the instant before he hit the ground, he knew. You always woke up in the instant before you hit the ground.
   And if you don¡¯t? the voice asked.
   The ground was closer now, still far far away, a thousand miles away, but closer than it had been. It was cold here in the darkness. There was no sun, no stars, only the ground below coming up to smash him, and the grey mists, and the whispering voice. He wanted to cry.
   Not cry. Fly.
   ¡°I can¡¯t fly,¡± Bran said. ¡°I can¡¯t, I can¡¯t?.?.?.?¡±
   How do you know? Have you ever tried?
   The voice was high and thin. Bran looked around to see where it was coming from. A crow was spiraling down with him, just out of reach, following him as he fell. ¡°Help me,¡± he said.
   I¡¯m trying, the crow replied. Say, got any corn?
   Bran reached into his pocket as the darkness spun dizzily around him. When he pulled his hand out, golden kernels slid from between his fingers into the air. They fell with him.
   The crow landed on his hand and began to eat.
   ¡°Are you really a crow?¡± Bran asked.
   Are you really falling? the crow asked back.
   ¡°It¡¯s just a dream,¡± Bran said.
   Is it? asked the crow.
   ¡°I¡¯ll wake up when I hit the ground,¡± Bran told the bird.
   You¡¯ll die when you hit the ground, the crow said. It went back to eating corn.
   Bran looked down. He could see mountains now, their peaks white with snow, and the silver thread of rivers in dark woods. He closed his eyes and began to cry.
   That won¡¯t do any good, the crow said. I told you, the answer is flying, not crying. How hard can it be? I¡¯m doing it. The crow took to the air and flapped around Bran¡¯s hand.
   ¡°You have wings,¡± Bran pointed out.
   Maybe you do too.
   Bran felt along his shoulders, groping for feathers.
   There are different kinds of wings, the crow said.
   Bran was staring at his arms, his legs. He was so skinny, just skin stretched taut over bones. Had he always been so thin? He tried to remember. A face swam up at him out of the grey mist, shining with light, golden. ¡°The things I do for love,¡± it said.
   Bran screamed.
   The crow took to the air, cawing. Not that, it shrieked at him. Forget that, you do not need it now, put it aside, put it away. It landed on Bran¡¯s shoulder, and pecked at him, and the shining golden face was gone.
   Bran was falling faster than ever. The grey mists howled around him as he plunged toward the earth below. ¡°What are you doing to me?¡± he asked the crow, tearful.
   Teaching you how to fly.
   ¡°I can¡¯t fly!¡±
   You¡¯re flying tight now.
   ¡°I¡¯m falling!¡±
   Every flight begins with a fall, the crow said. Look down.
   ¡°I¡¯m afraid?.?.?.?¡±
   LOOK DOWN!
   Bran looked down, and felt his insides turn to water. The ground was rushing up at him now. The whole world was spread out below him, a tapestry of white and brown and green. He could see everything so clearly that for a moment he forgot to be afraid. He could see the whole realm, and everyone in it.
   He saw Winterfell as the eagles see it, the tall towers looking squat and stubby from above, the castle walls just lines in the dirt. He saw Maester Luwin on his balcony, studying the sky through a polished bronze tube and frowning as he made notes in a book. He saw his brother Robb, taller and stronger than he remembered him, practicing swordplay in the yard with real steel in his hand. He saw Hodor, the simple giant from the stables, carrying an anvil to Mikken¡¯s forge, hefting it onto his shoulder as easily as another man might heft a bale of hay. At the heart of the godswood, the great white weirwood brooded over its reflection in the black pool, its leaves rustling in a chill wind. When it felt Bran watching, it lifted its eyes from the still waters and stared back at him knowingly.
   He looked east, and saw a galley racing across the waters of the Bite. He saw his mother sitting alone in a cabin, looking at a bloodstained knife on a table in front of her, as the rowers pulled at their oars and Ser Rodrik leaned across a rail, shaking and heaving. A storm was gathering ahead of them, a vast dark roaring lashed by lightning, but somehow they could not see it.
   He looked south, and saw the great blue-green rush of the Trident. He saw his father pleading with the king, his face etched with grief. He saw Sansa crying herself to sleep at night, and he saw Arya watching in silence and holding her secrets hard in her heart. There were shadows all around them. One shadow was dark as ash, with the terrible face of a hound. Another was armored like the sun, golden and beautiful. Over them both loomed a giant in armor made of stone, but when he opened his visor, there was nothing inside but darkness and thick black blood.
   He lifted his eyes and saw clear across the narrow sea, to the Free Cities and the green Dothraki sea and beyond, to Vaes Dothrak under its mountain, to the fabled lands of the Jade Sea, to Asshai by the Shadow, where dragons stirred beneath the sunrise.
   Finally he looked north. He saw the Wall shining like blue crystal, and his bastard brother Jon sleeping alone in a cold bed, his skin growing pale and hard as the memory of all warmth fled from him. And he looked past the Wall, past endless forests cloaked in snow, past the frozen shore and the great blue-white rivers of ice and the dead plains where nothing grew or lived. North and north and north he looked, to the curtain of light at the end of the world, and then beyond that curtain. He looked deep into the heart of winter, and then he cried out, afraid, and the heat of his tears burned on his cheeks.
   Now you know, the crow whispered as it sat on his shoulder. Now you know why you must live.
   ¡°Why?¡± Bran said, not understanding, falling, falling.
   Because winter is coming.
   Bran looked at the crow on his shoulder, and the crow looked back. It had three eyes, and the third eye was full of a terrible knowledge. Bran looked down. There was nothing below him now but snow and cold and death, a frozen wasteland where jagged blue-white spires of ice waited to embrace him. They flew up at him like spears. He saw the bones of a thousand other dreamers impaled upon their points. He was desperately afraid.
   ¡°Can a man still be brave if he¡¯s afraid?¡± he heard his own voice saying, small and far away.
   And his father¡¯s voice replied to him. ¡°That is the only time a man can be brave.¡±
   Now, Bran, the crow urged. Choose. Fly or die.
   Death reached for him, screaming.
   Bran spread his arms and flew.
   Wings unseen drank the wind and filled and pulled him upward. The terrible needles of ice receded below him. The sky opened up above. Bran soared. It was better than climbing. It was better than anything. The world grew small beneath him.
   ¡°I¡¯m flying!¡± he cried out in delight.
   I¡¯ve noticed, said the three-eyed crow. It took to the air, flapping its wings in his face, slowing him, blinding him. He faltered in the air as its pinions beat against his cheeks. Its beak stabbed at him fiercely, and Bran felt a sudden blinding pain in the middle of his forehead, between his eyes.
   ¡°What are you doing?¡± he shrieked.
   The crow opened its beak and cawed at him, a shrill scream of fear, and the grey mists shuddered and swirled around him and ripped away like a veil, and he saw that the crow was really a woman, a serving woman with long black hair, and he knew her from somewhere, from Winterfell, yes, that was it, he remembered her now, and then he realized that he was in Winterfell, in a bed high in some chilly tower room, and the black-haired woman dropped a basin of water to shatter on the floor and ran down the steps, shouting, ¡°He¡¯s awake, he¡¯s awake, he¡¯s awake.¡±
   Bran touched his forehead, between his eyes. The place where the crow had pecked him was still burning, but there was nothing there, no blood, no wound. He felt weak and dizzy. He tried to get out of bed, but nothing happened.
   And then there was movement beside the bed, and something landed lightly on his legs. He felt nothing. A pair of yellow eyes looked into his own, shining like the sun. The window was open and it was cold in the room, but the warmth that came off the wolf enfolded him like a hot bath. His pup, Bran realized?.?.?.?or was it? He was so big now. He reached out to pet him, his hand trembling like a leaf.
   When his brother Robb burst into the room, breathless from his dash up the tower steps, the direwolf was licking Bran¡¯s face. Bran looked up calmly. ¡°His name is Summer,¡± he said.
   
   18£®CATELYN
   We will make King¡¯s Landing within the hour.¡±
   Catelyn turned away from the rail and forced herself to smile. ¡°Your oarmen have done well by us, Captain. Each one of them shall have a silver stag, as a token of my gratitude.¡±
   Captain Moreo Turnitis favored her with a half bow. ¡°You are far too generous, Lady Stark. The honor of carrying a great lady like yourself is all the reward they need.¡±
   ¡°But they¡¯ll take the silver anyway.¡±
   Moreo smiled. ¡°As you say.¡± He spoke the Common Tongue fluently, with only the slightest hint of a Tyroshi accent. He¡¯d been plying the narrow sea for thirty years, he¡¯d told her, as oarman, quartermaster, and finally captain of his own trading galleys. The Storm Dancer was his fourth ship, and his fastest, a two-masted galley of sixty oars.
   She had certainly been the fastest of the ships available in White Harbor when Catelyn and Ser Rodrik Cassel had arrived after their headlong gallop downriver. The Tyroshi were notorious for their avarice, and Ser Rodrik had argued for hiring a fishing sloop out of the Three Sisters, but Catelyn had insisted on the galley. It was good that she had. The winds had been against them much of the voyage, and without the galley¡¯s oars they¡¯d still be beating their way past the Fingers, instead of skimming toward King¡¯s Landing and journey¡¯s end.
   So close, she thought. Beneath the linen bandages, her fingers still throbbed where the dagger had bitten. The pain was her scourge, Catelyn felt, lest she forget. She could not bend the last two fingers on her left hand, and the others would never again be dexterous. Yet that was a small enough price to pay for Bran¡¯s life.
   Ser Rodrik chose that moment to appear on deck. ¡°My good friend,¡± said Moreo through his forked green beard. The Tyroshi loved bright colors, even in their facial hair. ¡°It is so fine to see you looking better.¡±
   ¡°Yes,¡± Ser Rodrik agreed. ¡°I haven¡¯t wanted to die for almost two days now.¡± He bowed to Catelyn. ¡°My lady.¡±
   He was looking better. A shade thinner than he had been when they set out from White Harbor, but almost himself again. The strong winds in the Bite and the roughness of the narrow sea had not agreed with him, and he¡¯d almost gone over the side when the storm seized them unexpectedly off Dragonstone, yet somehow he had clung to a rope until three of Moreo¡¯s men could rescue him and carry him safely below decks.
   ¡°The captain was just telling me that our voyage is almost at an end,¡± she said.
   Ser Rodrik managed a wry smile. ¡°So soon?¡± He looked odd without his great white side whiskers; smaller somehow, less fierce, and ten years older. Yet back on the Bite it had seemed prudent to submit to a crewman¡¯s razor, after his whiskers had become hopelessly befouled for the third time while he leaned over the rail and retched into the swirling winds.
   ¡°I will leave you to discuss your business,¡± Captain Moreo said. He bowed and took his leave of them.
   The galley skimmed the water like a dragonfly, her oars rising and falling in perfect time. Ser Rodrik held the rail and looked out over the passing shore. ¡°I have not been the most valiant of protectors.¡±
   Catelyn touched his arm. ¡°We are here, Ser Rodrik, and safely. That is all that truly matters.¡± Her hand groped beneath her cloak, her fingers stiff and fumbling. The dagger was still at her side. She found she had to touch it now and then, to reassure herself. ¡°Now we must reach the king¡¯s master-at-arms, and pray that he can be trusted.¡±
   ¡°Ser Aron Santagar is a vain man, but an honest one.¡± Ser Rodrik¡¯s hand went to his face to stroke his whiskers and discovered once again that they were gone. He looked nonplussed. ¡°He may know the blade, yes?.?.?.?but, my lady, the moment we go ashore we are at risk. And there are those at court who will know you on sight.¡±
   Catelyn¡¯s mouth grew tight. ¡°Littlefinger,¡± she murmured. His face swam up before her; a boy¡¯s face, though he was a boy no longer. His father had died several years before, so he was Lord Baelish now, yet still they called him Littlefinger. Her brother Edmure had given him that name, long ago at Riverrun. His family¡¯s modest holdings were on the smallest of the Fingers, and Petyr had been slight and short for his age.
   Ser Rodrik cleared his throat. ¡°Lord Baelish once, ah?.?.?.?¡± His thought trailed off uncertainly in search of the polite word.
   Catelyn was past delicacy. ¡°He was my father¡¯s ward. We grew up together in Riverrun. I thought of him as a brother, but his feelings for me were?.?.?.?more than brotherly. When it was announced that I was to wed Brandon Stark, Petyr challenged for the right to my hand. It was madness. Brandon was twenty, Petyr scarcely fifteen. I had to beg Brandon to spare Petyr¡¯s life. He let him off with a scar. Afterward my father sent him away. I have not seen him since.¡± She lifted her face to the spray, as if the brisk wind could blow the memories away. ¡°He wrote to me at Riverrun after Brandon was killed, but I burned the letter unread. By then I knew that Ned would marry me in his brother¡¯s place.¡±
   Ser Rodrik¡¯s fingers fumbled once again for nonexistent whiskers. ¡°Littlefinger sits on the small council now.¡±
   ¡°I knew he would rise high,¡± Catelyn said. ¡°He was always clever, even as a boy, but it is one thing to be clever and another to be wise. I wonder what the years have done to him.¡±
   High overhead, the far-eyes sang out from the rigging. Captain Moreo came scrambling across the deck, giving orders, and all around them the Storm Dancer burst into frenetic activity as King¡¯s Landing slid into view atop its three high hills.
   Three hundred years ago, Catelyn knew, those heights had been covered with forest, and only a handful of fisherfolk had lived on the north shore of the Blackwater Rush where that deep, swift river flowed into the sea. Then Aegon the Conqueror had sailed from Dragonstone. It was here that his army had put ashore, and there on the highest hill that he built his first crude redoubt of wood and earth.
   Now the city covered the shore as far as Catelyn could see; manses and arbors and granaries, brick storehouses and timbered inns and merchant¡¯s stalls, taverns and graveyards and brothels, all piled one on another. She could hear the clamor of the fish market even at this distance. Between the buildings were broad roads lined with trees, wandering crookback streets, and alleys so narrow that two men could not walk abreast. Visenya¡¯s hill was crowned by the Great Sept of Baelor with its seven crystal towers. Across the city on the hill of Rhaenys stood the blackened walls of the Dragonpit, its huge dome collapsing into ruin, its bronze doors closed now for a century. The Street of the Sisters ran between them, straight as an arrow. The city walls rose in the distance, high and strong.
   A hundred quays lined the waterfront, and the harbor was crowded with ships. Deepwater fishing boats and river runners came and went, ferrymen poled back and forth across the Blackwater Rush, trading galleys unloaded goods from Braavos and Pentos and Lys. Catelyn spied the queen¡¯s ornate barge, tied up beside a fat-bellied whaler from the Port of Ibben, its hull black with tar, while upriver a dozen lean golden warships rested in their cribs, sails furled and cruel iron rams lapping at the water.
   And above it all, frowning down from Aegon¡¯s high hill, was the Red Keep; seven huge drum-towers crowned with iron ramparts, an immense grim barbican, vaulted halls and covered bridges, barracks and dungeons and granaries, massive curtain walls studded with archers¡¯ nests, all fashioned of pale red stone. Aegon the Conqueror had commanded it built. His son Maegor the Cruel had seen it completed. Afterward he had taken the heads of every stonemason, woodworker, and builder who had labored on it. Only the blood of the dragon would ever know the secrets of the fortress the Dragonlords had built, he vowed. 
   Yet now the banners that flew from its battlements were golden, not black, and where the three-headed dragon had once breathed fire, now pranced the crowned stag of House Baratheon.
   A high-masted swan ship from the Summer Isles was beating out from port, its white sails huge with wind. The Storm Dancer moved past it, pulling steadily for shore.
   ¡°My lady,¡± Ser Rodrik said, ¡°I have thought on how best to proceed while I lay abed. You must not enter the castle. I will go in your stead and bring Ser Aron to you in some safe place.¡±
   She studied the old knight as the galley drew near to a pier. Moreo was shouting in the vulgar Valyrian of the Free Cities. ¡°You would be as much at risk as I would.¡±
   Ser Rodrik smiled. ¡°I think not. I looked at my reflection in the water earlier and scarcely recognized myself. My mother was the last person to see me without whiskers, and she is forty years dead. I believe I am safe enough, my lady.¡±
   Moreo bellowed a command. As one, sixty oars lifted from the river, then reversed and backed water. The galley slowed. Another shout. The oars slid back inside the hull. As they thumped against the dock, Tyroshi seamen leapt down to tie up. Moreo came bustling up, all smiles. ¡°King¡¯s Landing, my lady, as you did command, and never has a ship made a swifter or surer passage. Will you be needing assistance to carry your things to the castle?¡±
   ¡°We shall not be going to the castle. Perhaps you can suggest an inn, someplace clean and comfortable and not too far from the river.¡±
   The Tyroshi fingered his forked green beard. ¡°Just so. I know of several establishments that might suit your needs. Yet first, if I may be so bold, there is the matter of the second half of the payment we agreed upon. And of course the extra silver you were so kind as to promise. Sixty stags, I believe it was.¡±
   ¡°For the oarmen,¡± Catelyn reminded him.
   ¡°Oh, of a certainty,¡± said Moreo. ¡°Though perhaps I should hold it for them until we return to Tyrosh. For the sake of their wives and children. If you give them the silver here, my lady, they will dice it away or spend it all for a night¡¯s pleasure.¡±
   ¡°There are worse things to spend money on,¡± Ser Rodrik put in. ¡°Winter is coming.¡±
   ¡°A man must make his own choices,¡± Catelyn said. ¡°They earned the silver. How they spend it is no concern of mine.¡±
   ¡°As you say, my lady,¡± Moreo replied, bowing and smiling.
   Just to be sure, Catelyn paid the oarmen herself, a stag to each man, and a copper to the two men who carried their chests halfway up Visenya¡¯s hill to the inn that Moreo had suggested. It was a rambling old place on Eel Alley. The woman who owned it was a sour crone with a wandering eye who looked them over suspiciously and bit the coin that Catelyn offered her to make sure it was real. Her rooms were large and airy, though, and Moreo swore that her fish stew was the most savory in all the Seven Kingdoms. Best of all, she had no interest in their names.
   ¡°I think it best if you stay away from the common room,¡± Ser Rodrik said, after they had settled in. ¡°Even in a place like this, one never knows who may be watching.¡± He wore ringmail, dagger, and longsword under a dark cloak with a hood he could pull up over his head. ¡°I will be back before nightfall, with Ser Aron,¡± he promised. ¡°Rest now, my lady.¡±
   Catelyn was tired. The voyage had been long and fati
   guing, and she was no longer as young as she had been. Her windows opened on the alley and rooftops, with a view of the Blackwater beyond. She watched Ser Rodrik set off, striding briskly through the busy streets until he was lost in the crowds, then decided to take his advice. The bedding was stuffed with straw instead of feathers, but she had no trouble falling asleep.
   She woke to a pounding on her door.
   Catelyn sat up sharply. Outside the window, the rooftops of King¡¯s Landing were red in the light of the setting sun. She had slept longer than she intended. A fist hammered at her door again, and a voice called out, ¡°Open, in the name of the king.¡±
   ¡°A moment,¡± she called out. She wrapped herself in her cloak. The dagger was on the bedside table. She snatched it up before she unlatched the heavy wooden door.
   The men who pushed into the room wore the black ringmail and golden cloaks of the City Watch. Their leader smiled at the dagger in her hand and said, ¡°No need for that, m¡¯lady. We¡¯re to escort you to the castle.¡±
   ¡°By whose authority?¡± she said.
   He showed her a ribbon. Catelyn felt her breath catch in her throat. The seal was a mockingbird, in grey wax. ¡°Petyr,¡± she said. So soon. Something must have happened to Ser Rodrik. She looked at the head guardsman. ¡°Do you know who I am?¡±
   ¡°No, m¡¯lady,¡± he said. ¡°M¡¯lord Littlefinger said only to bring you to him, and see that you were not mistreated.¡±
   Catelyn nodded. ¡°You may wait outside while I dress.¡±
   She bathed her hands in the basin and wrapped them in clean linen. Her fingers were thick and awkward as she struggled to lace up her bodice and knot a drab brown cloak about her neck. How could Littlefinger have known she was here? Ser Rodrik would never have told him. Old he might be, but he was stubborn, and loyal to a fault. Were they too late, had the Lannisters reached King¡¯s Landing before her? No, if that were true, Ned would be here too, and surely he would have come to her. How?.?.?.? ?
   Then she thought, Moreo. The Tyroshi knew who they were and where they were, damn him. She hoped he¡¯d gotten a good price for the information.
   They had brought a horse for her. The lamps were being lit along the streets as they set out, and Catelyn felt the eyes of the city on her as she rode, surrounded by the guard in their golden cloaks. When they reached the Red Keep, the portcullis was down and the great gates sealed for the night, but the castle windows were alive with flickering lights. The guardsmen left their mounts outside the walls and escorted her through a narrow postern door, then up endless steps to a tower.
   He was alone in the room, seated at a heavy wooden table, an oil lamp beside him as he wrote. When they ushered her inside, he set down his pen and looked at her. ¡°Cat,¡± he said quietly.
   ¡°Why have I been brought here in this fashion?¡±
   He rose and gestured brusquely to the guards. ¡°Leave us.¡± The men departed. ¡°You were not mistreated, I trust,¡± he said after they had gone. ¡°I gave firm instructions.¡± He noticed her bandages. ¡°Your hands?.?.?.?¡±
   Catelyn ignored the implied question. ¡°I am not accustomed to being summoned like a serving wench,¡± she said icily. ¡°As a boy, you still knew the meaning of courtesy.¡±
   ¡°I¡¯ve angered you, my lady. That was never my intent.¡± He looked contrite. The look brought back vivid memories for Catelyn. He had been a sly child, but after his mischiefs he always looked contrite; it was a gift he had. The years had not changed him much. Petyr had been a small boy, and he had grown into a small man, an inch or two shorter than Catelyn, slender and quick, with the sharp features she remembered and the same laughing grey-green eyes. He had a little pointed chin beard now, and threads of silver in his dark hair, though he was still shy of thirty. They went well with the silver mockingbird that fastened his cloak. Even as a child, he had always loved his silver.
   ¡°How did you know I was in the city?¡± she asked him.
   ¡°Lord Varys knows all,¡± Petyr said with a sly smile. ¡°He will be joining us shortly, but I wanted to see you alone first. It has been too long, Cat. How many years?¡±
   Catelyn ignored his familiarity. There were more important questions. ¡°So it was the King¡¯s Spider who found me.¡±
   Littlefinger winced. ¡°You don¡¯t want to call him that. He¡¯s very sensitive. Comes of being an eunuch, I imagine. Nothing happens in this city without Varys knowing. Oftimes he knows about it before it happens. He has informants everywhere. His little birds, he calls them. One of his little birds heard about your visit. Thankfully, Varys came to me first.¡±
   ¡°Why you?¡±
   He shrugged. ¡°Why not me? I am master of coin, the king¡¯s own councillor. Selmy and Lord Renly rode north to meet Robert, and Lord Stannis is gone to Dragonstone, leaving only Maester Pycelle and me. I was the obvious choice. I was ever a friend to your sister Lysa, Varys knows that.¡±
   ¡°Does Varys know about?.?.?.?¡±
   ¡°Lord Varys knows everything?.?.?.?except why you are here.¡± He lifted an eyebrow. ¡°Why are you here?¡±
   ¡°A wife is allowed to yearn for her husband, and if a mother needs her daughters close, who can tell her no?¡±
   Littlefinger laughed. ¡°Oh, very good, my lady, but please don¡¯t expect me to believe that. I know you too well. What were the Tully words again?¡±
   Her throat was dry. ¡°Family, Duty, Honor,¡± she recited stiffly. He did know her too well.
   ¡°Family, Duty, Honor,¡± he echoed. ¡°All of which required you to remain in Winterfell, where our Hand left you. No, my lady, something has happened. This sudden trip of yours bespeaks a certain urgency. I beg of you, let me help. Old sweet friends should never hesitate to rely upon each other.¡± There was a soft knock on the door. ¡°Enter,¡± Littlefinger called out.
   The man who stepped through the door was plump, perfumed, powdered, and as hairless as an egg. He wore a vest of woven gold thread over a loose gown of purple silk, and on his feet were pointed slippers of soft velvet. ¡°Lady Stark,¡± he said, taking her hand in both of his, ¡°to see you again after so many years is such a joy.¡± His flesh was soft and moist, and his breath smelled of lilacs. ¡°Oh, your poor hands. Have you burned yourself, sweet lady? The fingers are so delicate?.?.?.?Our good Maester Pycelle makes a marvelous salve, shall I send for a jar?¡±
   Catelyn slid her fingers from his grasp. ¡°I thank you, my lord, but my own Maester Luwin has already seen to my hurts.¡±
   Varys bobbed his head. ¡°I was grievous sad to hear about your son. And him so young. The gods are cruel.¡±
   ¡°On that we agree, Lord Varys,¡± she said. The title was but a courtesy due him as a council member; Varys was lord of nothing but the spiderweb, the master of none but his whisperers.
   The eunuch spread his soft hands. ¡°On more than that, I hope, sweet lady. I have great esteem for your husband, our new Hand, and I know we do both love King Robert.¡±
   ¡°Yes,¡± she was forced to say. ¡°For a certainty.¡±
   ¡°Never has a king been so beloved as our Robert,¡± quipped Littlefinger. He smiled slyly. ¡°At least in Lord Varys¡¯s hearing.¡±
   ¡°Good lady,¡± Varys said with great solicitude. ¡°There are men in the Free Cities with wondrous healing powers. Say only the word, and I will send for one for your dear Bran.¡±
   ¡°Maester Luwin is doing all that can be done for Bran,¡± she told him. She would not speak of Bran, not here, not with these men. She trusted Littlefinger only a little, and Varys not at all. She would not let them see her grief. ¡°Lord Baelish tells me that I have you to thank for bringing me here.¡±
   Varys giggled like a little girl. ¡°Oh, yes. I suppose I am guilty. I hope you forgive me, kind lady.¡± He eased himself down into a seat and put his hands together. ¡°I wonder if we might trouble you to show us the dagger?¡±
   Catelyn Stark stared at the eunuch in stunned disbelief. He was a spider, she thought wildly, an enchanter or worse. He knew things no one could possibly know, unless?.?.?.?¡°What have you done to Ser Rodrik?¡± she demanded.
   Littlefinger was lost. ¡°I feel rather like the knight who arrives at the battle without his lance. What dagger are we talking about? Who is Ser Rodrik?¡±
   ¡°Ser Rodrik Cassel is master-at-arms at Winterfell,¡± Varys informed him. ¡°I assure you, Lady Stark, nothing at all has been done to the good knight. He did call here early this afternoon. He visited with Ser Aron Santagar in the armory, and they talked of a certain dagger. About sunset, they left the castle together and walked to that dreadful hovel where you were staying. They are still there, drinking in the common room, waiting for your return. Ser Rodrik was very distressed to find you gone.¡±
   ¡°How could you know all that?¡±
   ¡°The whisperings of little birds,¡± Varys said, smiling. ¡°I know things, sweet lady. That is the nature of my service.¡± He shrugged. ¡°You do have the dagger with you, yes?¡±
   Catelyn pulled it out from beneath her cloak and threw it down on the table in front of him. ¡°Here. Perhaps your little birds will whisper the name of the man it belongs to.¡±
   Varys lifted the knife with exaggerated delicacy and ran a thumb along its edge. Blood welled, and he let out a squeal and dropped the dagger back on the table.
   ¡°Careful,¡± Catelyn told him, ¡°it¡¯s sharp.¡±
   ¡°Nothing holds an edge like Valyrian steel,¡± Littlefinger said as Varys sucked at his bleeding thumb and looked at Catelyn with sullen admonition. Littlefinger hefted the knife lightly in his hand, testing the grip. He flipped it in the air, caught it again with his other hand. ¡°Such sweet balance. You want to find the owner, is that the reason for this visit? You have no need of Ser Aron for that, my lady. You should have come to me.¡±
   ¡°And if I had,¡± she said, ¡°what would you have told me?¡±
   ¡°I would have told you that there was only one knife like this at King¡¯s Landing.¡± He grasped the blade between thumb and forefinger, drew it back over his shoulder, and threw it across the room with a practiced flick of his wrist. It struck the door and buried itself deep in the oak, quivering. ¡°It¡¯s mine.¡±
   ¡°Yours?¡± It made no sense. Petyr had not been at Winterfell.
   ¡°Until the tourney on Prince Joffrey¡¯s name day,¡± he said, crossing the room to wrench the dagger from the wood. ¡°I backed Ser Jaime in the jousting, along with half the court.¡± Petyr¡¯s sheepish grin made him look half a boy again. ¡°When Loras Tyrell unhorsed him, many of us became a trifle poorer. Ser Jaime lost a hundred golden dragons, the queen lost an emerald pendant, and I lost my knife. Her Grace got the emerald back, but the winner kept the rest.¡±
   ¡°Who?¡± Catelyn demanded, her mouth dry with fear. Her fingers ached with remembered pain.
   ¡°The Imp,¡± said Littlefinger as Lord Varys watched her face. ¡°Tyrion Lannister.¡±
   
   19£®JON
   The courtyard rang to the song of swords.
   Under black wool, boiled leather, and mail, sweat trickled icily down Jon¡¯s chest as he pressed the attack. Grenn stumbled backward, defending himself clumsily. When he raised his sword, Jon went underneath it with a sweeping blow that crunched against the back of the other boy¡¯s leg and sent him staggering. Grenn¡¯s downcut was answered by an overhand that dented his helm. When he tried a sideswing, Jon swept aside his blade and slammed a mailed forearm into his chest. Grenn lost his footing and sat down hard in the snow. Jon knocked his sword from his fingers with a slash to his wrist that brought a cry of pain.
   ¡°Enough!¡± Ser Alliser Thorne had a voice with an edge like Valyrian steel.
   Grenn cradled his hand. ¡°The bastard broke my wrist.¡±
   ¡°The bastard hamstrung you, opened your empty skull, and cut off your hand. Or would have, if these blades had an edge. It¡¯s fortunate for you that the Watch needs stableboys as well as rangers.¡± Ser Alliser gestured at Jeren and Toad. ¡°Get the Aurochs on his feet, he has funeral arrangements to make.¡±
   Jon took off his helm as the other boys were pulling Grenn to his feet. The frosty morning air felt good on his face. He leaned on his sword, drew a deep breath, and allowed himself a moment to savor the victory.
   ¡°That is a longsword, not an old man¡¯s cane,¡± Ser Alliser said sharply. ¡°Are your legs hurting, Lord Snow?¡±
   Jon hated that name, a mockery that Ser Alliser had hung on him the first day he came to practice. The boys had picked it up, and now he heard it everywhere. He slid the longsword back into its scabbard. ¡°No,¡± he replied.
   Thorne strode toward him, crisp black leathers whispering faintly as he moved. He was a compact man of fifty years, spare and hard, with grey in his black hair and eyes like chips of onyx. ¡°The truth now,¡± he commanded.
   ¡°I¡¯m tired,¡± Jon admitted. His arm burned from the weight of the longsword, and he was starting to feel his bruises now that the fight was done.
   ¡°What you are is weak.¡±
   ¡°I won.¡±
   ¡°No. The Aurochs lost.¡±
   One of the other boys sniggered. Jon knew better than to reply. He had beaten everyone that Ser Alliser had sent against him, yet it gained him nothing. The master-at-arms served up only derision. Thorne hated him, Jon had decided; of course, he hated the other boys even worse.
   ¡°That will be all,¡± Thorne told them. ¡°I can only stomach so much ineptitude in any one day. If the Others ever come for us, I pray they have archers, because you lot are fit for nothing more than arrow fodder.¡±
   Jon followed the rest back to the armory, walking alone. He often walked alone here. There were almost twenty in the group he trained with, yet not one he could call a friend. Most were two or three years his senior, yet not one was half the fighter Robb had been at fourteen. Dareon was quick but afraid of being hit. Pyp used his sword like a dagger, Jeren was weak as a girl, Grenn slow and clumsy. Halder¡¯s blows were brutally hard but he ran right into your attacks. The more time he spent with them, the more Jon despised them.
   Inside, Jon hung sword and scabbard from a hook in the stone wall, ignoring the others around him. Methodically, he began to strip off his mail, leather, and sweat-soaked woolens. Chunks of coal burned in iron braziers at either end of the long room, but Jon found himself shivering. The chill was always with him here. In a few years he would forget what it felt like to be warm.
   The weariness came on him suddenly, as he donned the roughspun blacks that were their everyday wear. He sat on a bench, his fingers fumbling with the fastenings on his cloak. So cold, he thought, remembering the warm halls of Winterfell, where the hot waters ran through the walls like blood through a man¡¯s body. There was scant warmth to be found in Castle Black; the walls were cold here, and the people colder.
   No one had told him the Night¡¯s Watch would be like this; no one except Tyrion Lannister. The dwarf had given him the truth on the road north, but by then it had been too late. Jon wondered if his father had known what the Wall would be like. He must have, he thought; that only made it hurt the worse.
   Even his uncle had abandoned him in this cold place at the end of the world. Up here, the genial Benjen Stark he had known became a different person. He was First Ranger, and he spent his days and nights with Lord Commander Mormont and Maester Aemon and the other high officers, while Jon was given over to the less than tender charge of Ser Alliser Thorne.
   Three days after their arrival, Jon had heard that Benjen Stark was to lead a half-dozen men on a ranging into the haunted forest. That night he sought out his uncle in the great timbered common hall and pleaded to go with him. Benjen refused him curtly. ¡°This is not Winterfell,¡± he told him as he cut his meat with fork and dagger. ¡°On the Wall, a man gets only what he earns. You¡¯re no ranger, Jon, only a green boy with the smell of summer still on you.¡±
   Stupidly, Jon argued. ¡°I¡¯ll be fifteen on my name day,¡± he said. ¡°Almost a man grown.¡±
   Benjen Stark frowned. ¡°A boy you are, and a boy you¡¯ll remain until Ser Alliser says you are fit to be a man of the Night¡¯s Watch. If you thought your Stark blood would win you easy favors, you were wrong. We put aside our old families when we swear our vows. Your father will always have a place in my heart, but these are my brothers now.¡± He gestured with his dagger at the men around them, all the hard cold men in black.
   Jon rose at dawn the next day to watch his uncle leave. One of his rangers, a big ugly man, sang a bawdy song as he saddled his garron, his breath steaming in the cold morning air. Ben Stark smiled at that, but he had no smile for his nephew. ¡°How often must I tell you no, Jon? We¡¯ll speak when I return.¡±
   As he watched his uncle lead his horse into the tunnel, Jon had remembered the things that Tyrion Lannister told him on the kingsroad, and in his mind¡¯s eye he saw Ben Stark lying dead, his blood red on the snow. The thought made him sick. What was he becoming?
   Afterward he sought out Ghost in the loneliness of his cell, and buried his face in his thick white fur.
   If he must be alone, he would make solitude his armor. Castle Black had no godswood, only a small sept and a drunken septon, but Jon could not find it in him to pray to any gods, old or new. If they were real, he thought, they were as cruel and implacable as winter.
   He missed his true brothers: little Rickon, bright eyes shining as he begged for a sweet; Robb, his rival and best friend and constant companion; Bran, stubborn and curious, always wanting to follow and join in whatever Jon and Robb were doing. He missed the girls too, even Sansa, who never called him anything but ¡°my half brother¡± since she was old enough to understand what bastard meant. And Arya?.?.?.?he missed her even more than Robb, skinny little thing that she was, all scraped knees and tangled hair and torn clothes, so fierce and willful. Arya never seemed to fit, no more than he had?.?.?.?yet she could always make Jon smile. He would give anything to be with her now, to muss up her hair once more and watch her make a face, to hear her finish a sentence with him.
   ¡°You broke my wrist, bastard boy.¡±
   Jon lifted his eyes at the sullen voice. Grenn loomed over him, thick of neck and red of face, with three of his friends behind him. He knew Todder, a short ugly boy with an unpleasant voice. The recruits all called him Toad. The other two were the ones Yoren had brought north with them, Jon remembered, rapers taken down in the Fingers. He¡¯d forgotten their names. He hardly ever spoke to them, if he could help it. They were brutes and bullies, without a thimble of honor between them.
   Jon stood up. ¡°I¡¯ll break the other one for you if you ask nicely.¡± Grenn was sixteen and a head taller than Jon. All four of them were bigger than he was, but they did not scare him. He¡¯d beaten every one of them in the yard.
   ¡°Maybe we¡¯ll break you,¡± one of the rapers said.
   ¡°Try.¡± Jon reached back for his sword, but one of them grabbed his arm and twisted it behind his back.
   ¡°You make us look bad,¡± complained Toad.
   ¡°You looked bad before I ever met you,¡± Jon told him. The boy who had his arm jerked upward on him, hard. Pain lanced through him, but Jon would not cry out.
   Toad stepped close. ¡°The little lordling has a mouth on him,¡± he said. He had pig eyes, small and shiny. ¡°Is that your mommy¡¯s mouth, bastard? What was she, some whore? Tell us her name. Maybe I had her a time or two.¡± He laughed.
   Jon twisted like an eel and slammed a heel down across the instep of the boy holding him. There was a sudden cry of pain, and he was free. He flew at Toad, knocked him backward over a bench, and landed on his chest with both hands on his throat, slamming his head against the packed earth.
   The two from the Fingers pulled him off, throwing him roughly to the ground. Grenn began to kick at him. Jon was rolling away from the blows when a booming voice cut through the gloom of the armory. ¡°STOP THIS! NOW!¡±
   Jon pulled himself to his feet. Donal Noye stood glowering at them. ¡°The yard is for fighting,¡± the armorer said. ¡°Keep your quarrels out of my armory, or I¡¯ll make them my quarrels. You won¡¯t like that.¡±
   Toad sat on the floor, gingerly feeling the back of his head. His fingers came away bloody. ¡°He tried to kill me.¡±
   ¡° ¡¯S true. I saw it,¡± one of the rapers put in.
   ¡°He broke my wrist,¡± Grenn said again, holding it out to Noye for inspection.
   The armorer gave the offered wrist the briefest of glances. ¡°A bruise. Perhaps a sprain. Maester Aemon will give you a salve. Go with him, Todder, that head wants looking after. The rest of you, return to your cells. Not you, Snow. You stay.¡±
   Jon sat heavily on the long wooden bench as the others left, oblivious to the looks they gave him, the silent promises of future retribution. His arm was throbbing.
   ¡°The Watch has need of every man it can get,¡± Donal Noye said when they were alone. ¡°Even men like Toad. You won¡¯t win any honors killing him.¡±
   Jon¡¯s anger flared. ¡°He said my mother was...¡±
   ¡°...a whore. I heard him. What of it?¡±
   ¡°Lord Eddard Stark was not a man to sleep with whores,¡± Jon said icily. ¡°His honor...¡±
   ¡°...did not prevent him from fathering a bastard. Did it?¡±
   Jon was cold with rage. ¡°Can I go?¡±
   ¡°You go when I tell you to go.¡±
   Jon stared sullenly at the smoke rising from the brazier, until Noye took him under the chin, thick fingers twisting his head around. ¡°Look at me when I¡¯m talking to you, boy.¡±
   Jon looked. The armorer had a chest like a keg of ale and a gut to match. His nose was flat and broad, and he always seemed in need of a shave. The left sleeve of his black wool tunic was fastened at the shoulder with a silver pin in the shape of a longsword. ¡°Words won¡¯t make your mother a whore. She was what she was, and nothing Toad says can change that. You know, we have men on the Wall whose mothers were whores.¡±
   Not my mother, Jon thought stubbornly. He knew nothing of his mother; Eddard Stark would not talk of her. Yet he dreamed of her at times, so often that he could almost see her face. In his dreams, she was beautiful, and highborn, and her eyes were kind.
   ¡°You think you had it hard, being a high lord¡¯s bastard?¡± the armorer went on. ¡°That boy Jeren is a septon¡¯s get, and Cotter Pyke is the baseborn son of a tavern wench. Now he commands Eastwatch by the Sea.¡±
   ¡°I don¡¯t care,¡± Jon said. ¡°I don¡¯t care about them and I don¡¯t care about you or Thorne or Benjen Stark or any of it. I hate it here. It¡¯s too?.?.?.? it¡¯s cold.¡±
   ¡°Yes. Cold and hard and mean, that¡¯s the Wall, and the men who walk it. Not like the stories your wet nurse told you. Well, piss on the stories and piss on your wet nurse. This is the way it is, and you¡¯re here for life, same as the rest of us.¡±
   ¡°Life,¡± Jon repeated bitterly. The armorer could talk about life. He¡¯d had one. He¡¯d only taken the black after he¡¯d lost an arm at the siege of Storm¡¯s End. Before that he¡¯d smithed for Stannis Baratheon, the king¡¯s brother. He¡¯d seen the Seven Kingdoms from one end to the other; he¡¯d feasted and wenched and fought in a hundred battles. They said it was Donal Noye who¡¯d forged King Robert¡¯s warhammer, the one that crushed the life from Rhaegar Targaryen on the Trident. He¡¯d done all the things that Jon would never do, and then when he was old, well past thirty, he¡¯d taken a glancing blow from an axe and the wound had festered until the whole arm had to come off. Only then, crippled, had Donal Noye come to the Wall, when his life was all but over.
   ¡°Yes, life,¡± Noye said. ¡°A long life or a short one, it¡¯s up to you, Snow. The road you¡¯re walking, one of your brothers will slit your throat for you one night.¡±
   ¡°They¡¯re not my brothers,¡± Jon snapped. ¡°They hate me because I¡¯m better than they are.¡±
   ¡°No. They hate you because you act like you¡¯re better than they are. They look at you and see a castle-bred bastard who thinks he¡¯s a lordling.¡± The armorer leaned close. ¡°You¡¯re no lordling. Remember that. You¡¯re a Snow, not a Stark. You¡¯re a bastard and a bully.¡±
   ¡°A bully?¡± Jon almost choked on the word. The accusation was so unjust it took his breath away. ¡°They were the ones who came after me. Four of them.¡±
   ¡°Four that you¡¯ve humiliated in the yard. Four who are probably afraid of you. I¡¯ve watched you fight. It¡¯s not training with you. Put a good edge on your sword, and they¡¯d be dead meat; you know it, I know it, they know it. You leave them nothing. You shame them. Does that make you proud?¡±
   Jon hesitated. He did feel proud when he won. Why shouldn¡¯t he? But the armorer was taking that away too, making it sound as if he were doing something wrong. ¡°They¡¯re all older than me,¡± he said defensively.
   ¡°Older and bigger and stronger, that¡¯s the truth. I¡¯ll wager your master-at-arms taught you how to fight bigger men at Winterfell, though. Who was he, some old knight?¡±
   ¡°Ser Rodrik Cassel,¡± Jon said warily. There was a trap here. He felt it closing around him.
   Donal Noye leaned forward, into Jon¡¯s face. ¡°Now think on this, boy. None of these others have ever had a master-at-arms until Ser Alliser. Their fathers were farmers and wagonmen and poachers, smiths and miners and oars on a trading galley. What they know of fighting they learned between decks, in the alleys of Oldtown and Lannisport, in wayside brothels and taverns on the kingsroad. They may have clacked a few sticks together before they came here, but I promise you, not one in twenty was ever rich enough to own a real sword.¡± His look was grim. ¡°So how do you like the taste of your victories now, Lord Snow?¡±
   ¡°Don¡¯t call me that!¡± Jon said sharply, but the force had gone out of his anger. Suddenly he felt ashamed and guilty. ¡°I never?.?.?.? I didn¡¯t think?.?.?.?¡±
   ¡°Best you start thinking,¡± Noye warned him. ¡°That, or sleep with a dagger by your bed. Now go.¡±
   By the time Jon left the armory, it was almost midday. The sun had broken through the clouds. He turned his back on it and lifted his eyes to the Wall, blazing blue and crystalline in the sunlight. Even after all these weeks, the sight of it still gave him the shivers. Centuries of windblown dirt had pocked and scoured it, covering it like a film, and it often seemed a pale grey, the color of an overcast sky?.?.?.?but when the sun caught it fair on a bright day, it shone, alive with light, a colossal blue-white cliff that filled up half the sky.
   The largest structure ever built by the hands of man, Benjen Stark had told Jon on the kingsroad when they had first caught sight of the Wall in the distance. ¡°And beyond a doubt the most useless,¡± Tyrion Lannister had added with a grin, but even the Imp grew silent as they rode closer. You could see it from miles off, a pale blue line across the northern horizon, stretching away to the east and west and vanishing in the far distance, immense and unbroken. This is the end of the world, it seemed to say.
   When they finally spied Castle Black, its timbered keeps and stone towers looked like nothing more than a handful of toy blocks scattered on the snow, beneath the vast wall of ice. The ancient stronghold of the black brothers was no Winterfell, no true castle at all. Lacking walls, it could not be defended, not from the south, or east, or west; but it was only the north that concerned the Night¡¯s Watch, and to the north loomed the Wall. Almost seven hundred feet high it stood, three times the height of the tallest tower in the stronghold it sheltered. His uncle said the top was wide enough for a dozen armored knights to ride abreast. The gaunt outlines of huge catapults and monstrous wooden cranes stood sentry up there, like the skeletons of great birds, and among them walked men in black as small as ants.
   As he stood outside the armory looking up, Jon felt almost as overwhelmed as he had that day on the kingsroad, when he¡¯d seen it for the first time. The Wall was like that. Sometimes he could almost forget that it was there, the way you forgot about the sky or the earth underfoot, but there were other times when it seemed as if there was nothing else in the world. It was older than the Seven Kingdoms, and when he stood beneath it and looked up, it made Jon dizzy. He could feel the great weight of all that ice pressing down on him, as if it were about to topple, and somehow Jon knew that if it fell, the world fell with it.
   ¡°Makes you wonder what lies beyond,¡± a familiar voice said.
   Jon looked around. ¡°Lannister. I didn¡¯t see, I mean, I thought I was alone.¡±
   Tyrion Lannister was bundled in furs so thickly he looked like a very small bear. ¡°There¡¯s much to be said for taking people unawares. You never know what you might learn.¡±
   ¡°You won¡¯t learn anything from me,¡± Jon told him. He had seen little of the dwarf since their journey ended. As the queen¡¯s own brother, Tyrion Lannister had been an honored guest of the Night¡¯s Watch. The Lord Commander had given him rooms in the King¡¯s Tower, so-called, though no king had visited it for a hundred years, and Lannister dined at Mormont¡¯s own table and spent his days riding the Wall and his nights dicing and drinking with Ser Alliser and Bowen Marsh and the other high officers.
   ¡°Oh, I learn things everywhere I go.¡± The little man gestured up at the Wall with a gnarled black walking stick. ¡°As I was saying?.?.?.?why is it that when one man builds a wall, the next man immediately needs to know what¡¯s on the other side?¡± He cocked his head and looked at Jon with his curious mismatched eyes. ¡°You do want to know what¡¯s on the other side, don¡¯t you?¡±
   ¡°It¡¯s nothing special,¡± Jon said. He wanted to ride with Benjen Stark on his rangings, deep into the mysteries of the haunted forest, wanted to fight Mance Rayder¡¯s wildlings and ward the realm against the Others, but it was better not to speak of the things you wanted. ¡°The rangers say it¡¯s just woods and mountains and frozen lakes, with lots of snow and ice.¡±
   ¡°And the grumkins and the snarks,¡± Tyrion said. ¡°Let us not forget them, Lord Snow, or else what¡¯s that big thing for?¡±
   ¡°Don¡¯t call me Lord Snow.¡±
   The dwarf lifted an eyebrow. ¡°Would you rather be called the Imp? Let them see that their words can cut you, and you¡¯ll never be free of the mockery. If they want to give you a name, take it, make it your own. Then they can¡¯t hurt you with it anymore.¡± He gestured with his stick. ¡°Come, walk with me. They¡¯ll be serving some vile stew in the common hall by now, and I could do with a bowl of something hot.¡±
   Jon was hungry too, so he fell in beside Lannister and slowed his pace to match the dwarf¡¯s awkward, waddling steps. The wind was rising, and they could hear the old wooden buildings creaking around them, and in the distance a heavy shutter banging, over and over, forgotten. Once there was a muffled thump as a blanket of snow slid from a roof and landed near them.
   ¡°I don¡¯t see your wolf,¡± Lannister said as they walked.
   ¡°I chain him up in the old stables when we¡¯re training. They board all the horses in the east stables now, so no one bothers him. The rest of the time he stays with me. My sleeping cell is in Hardin¡¯s Tower.¡±
   ¡°That¡¯s the one with the broken battlement, no? Shattered stone in the yard below, and a lean to it like our noble king Robert after a long night¡¯s drinking? I thought all those buildings had been abandoned.¡±
   Jon shrugged. ¡°No one cares where you sleep. Most of the old keeps are empty, you can pick any cell you want.¡± Once Castle Black had housed five thousand fighting men with all their horses and servants and weapons. Now it was home to a tenth that number, and parts of it were falling into ruin.
   Tyrion Lannister¡¯s laughter steamed in the cold air. ¡°I¡¯ll be sure to tell your father to arrest more stonemasons, before your tower collapses.¡±
   Jon could taste the mockery there, but there was no denying the truth. The Watch had built nineteen great strongholds along the Wall, but only three were still occupied: Eastwatch on its grey windswept shore, the Shadow Tower hard by the mountains where the Wall ended, and Castle Black between them, at the end of the kingsroad. The other keeps, long deserted, were lonely, haunted places, where cold winds whistled through black windows and the spirits of the dead manned the parapets.
   ¡°It¡¯s better that I¡¯m by myself,¡± Jon said stubbornly. ¡°The rest of them are scared of Ghost.¡±
   ¡°Wise boys,¡± Lannister said. Then he changed the subject. ¡°The talk is, your uncle is too long away.¡±
   Jon remembered the wish he¡¯d wished in his anger, the vision of Benjen Stark dead in the snow, and he looked away quickly. The dwarf had a way of sensing things, and Jon did not want him to see the guilt in his eyes. ¡°He said he¡¯d be back by my name day,¡± he admitted. His name day had come and gone, unremarked, a fortnight past. ¡°They were looking for Ser Waymar Royce, his father is bannerman to Lord Arryn. Uncle Benjen said they might search as far as the Shadow Tower. That¡¯s all the way up in the mountains.¡±
   ¡°I hear that a good many rangers have vanished of late,¡± Lannister said as they mounted the steps to the common hall. He grinned and pulled open the door. ¡°Perhaps the grumkins are hungry this year.¡±
   Inside, the hall was immense and drafty, even with a fire roaring in its great hearth. Crows nested in the timbers of its lofty ceiling. Jon heard their cries overhead as he accepted a bowl of stew and a heel of black bread from the day¡¯s cooks. Grenn and Toad and some of the others were seated at the bench nearest the warmth, laughing and cursing each other in rough voices. Jon eyed them thoughtfully for a moment. Then he chose a spot at the far end of the hall, well away from the other diners.
   Tyrion Lannister sat across from him, sniffing at the stew suspiciously. ¡°Barley, onion, carrot,¡± he muttered. ¡°Someone should tell the cooks that turnip isn¡¯t a meat.¡±
   ¡°It¡¯s mutton stew.¡± Jon pulled off his gloves and warmed his hands in the steam rising from the bowl. The smell made his mouth water.
   ¡°Snow.¡±
   Jon knew Alliser Thorne¡¯s voice, but there was a curious note in it that he had not heard before. He turned.
   ¡°The Lord Commander wants to see you. Now.¡±
   For a moment Jon was too frightened to move. Why would the Lord Commander want to see him? They had heard something about Benjen, he thought wildly, he was dead, the vision had come true. ¡°Is it my uncle?¡± he blurted. ¡°Is he returned safe?¡±
   ¡°The Lord Commander is not accustomed to waiting,¡± was Ser Alliser¡¯s reply. ¡°And I am not accustomed to having my commands questioned by bastards.¡±
   Tyrion Lannister swung off the bench and rose. ¡°Stop it, Thorne. You¡¯re frightening the boy.¡±
   ¡°Keep out of matters that don¡¯t concern you, Lannister. You have no place here.¡±
   ¡°I have a place at court, though,¡± the dwarf said, smiling. ¡°A word in the right ear, and you¡¯ll die a sour old man before you get another boy to train. Now tell Snow why the Old Bear needs to see him. Is there news of his uncle?¡±
   ¡°No,¡± Ser Alliser said. ¡°This is another matter entirely. A bird arrived this morning from Winterfell, with a message that concerns his brother.¡± He corrected himself. ¡°His half brother.¡±
   ¡°Bran,¡± Jon breathed, scrambling to his feet. ¡°Something¡¯s happened to Bran.¡±
   Tyrion Lannister laid a hand on his arm. ¡°Jon,¡± he said. ¡°I am truly sorry.¡±
   Jon scarcely heard him. He brushed off Tyrion¡¯s hand and strode across the hall. He was running by the time he hit the doors. He raced to the Commander¡¯s Keep, dashing through drifts of old snow. When the guards passed him, he took the tower steps two at a time. By the time he burst into the presence of the Lord Commander, his boots were soaked and Jon was wild-eyed and panting. ¡°Bran,¡± he said. ¡°What does it say about Bran?¡±
   Jeor Mormont, Lord Commander of the Night¡¯s Watch, was a gruff old man with an immense bald head and a shaggy grey beard. He had a raven on his arm, and he was feeding it kernels of corn. ¡°I am told you can read.¡± He shook the raven off, and it flapped its wings and flew to the window, where it sat watching as Mormont drew a roll of paper from his belt and handed it to Jon. ¡°Corn,¡± it muttered in a raucous voice. ¡°Corn, corn.¡±
   Jon¡¯s finger traced the outline of the direwolf in the white wax of the broken seat. He recognized Robb¡¯s hand, but the letters seemed to blur and run as he tried to read them. He realized he was crying. And then, through the tears, he found the sense in the words, and raised his head. ¡°He woke up,¡± he said. ¡°The gods gave him back.¡±
   ¡°Crippled,¡± Mormont said. ¡°I¡¯m sorry, boy. Read the rest of the letter.¡±
   He looked at the words, but they didn¡¯t matter. Nothing mattered. Bran was going to live. ¡°My brother is going to live,¡± he told Mormont. The Lord Commander shook his head, gathered up a fistful of corn, and whistled. The raven flew to his shoulder, crying, ¡°Live! Live!¡±
   Jon ran down the stairs, a smile on his face and Robb¡¯s letter in his hand. ¡°My brother is going to live,¡± he told the guards. They exchanged a look. He ran back to the common hall, where he found Tyrion Lannister just finishing his meal. He grabbed the little man under the arms, hoisted him up in the air, and spun him around in a circle. ¡°Bran is going to live!¡± he whooped. Lannister looked startled. Jon put him down and thrust the paper into his hands. ¡°Here, read it,¡± he said.
   Others were gathering around and looking at him curiously. Jon noticed Grenn a few feet away. A thick woolen bandage was wrapped around one hand. He looked anxious and uncomfortable, not menacing at all. Jon went to him. Grenn edged backward and put up his hands. ¡°Stay away from me now, you bastard.¡±
   Jon smiled at him. ¡°I¡¯m sorry about your wrist. Robb used the same move on me once, only with a wooden blade. It hurt like seven hells, but yours must be worse. Look, if you want, I can show you how to defend that.¡±
   Alliser Thorne overheard him. ¡°Lord Snow wants to take my place now.¡± He sneered. ¡°I¡¯d have an easier time teaching a wolf to juggle than you will training this aurochs.¡±
   ¡°I¡¯ll take that wager, Ser Alliser,¡± Jon said. ¡°I¡¯d love to see Ghost juggle.¡±
   Jon heard Grenn suck in his breath, shocked. Silence fell.
   Then Tyrion Lannister guffawed. Three of the black brothers joined in from a nearby table. The laughter spread up and down the benches, until even the cooks joined in. The birds stirred in the rafters, and finally even Grenn began to chuckle.
   Ser Alliser never took his eyes from Jon. As the laughter rolled around him, his face darkened, and his sword hand curled into a fist. ¡°That was a grievous error, Lord Snow,¡± he said at last in the acid tones of an enemy.
   
   20£®EDDARD
   Eddard Stark rode through the towering bronze doors of the Red Keep sore, tired, hungry, and irritable. He was still ahorse, dreaming of a long hot soak, a roast fowl, and a featherbed, when the king¡¯s steward told him that Grand Maester Pycelle had convened an urgent meeting of the small council. The honor of the Hand¡¯s presence was requested as soon as it was convenient. ¡°It will be convenient on the morrow,¡± Ned snapped as he dismounted.
   The steward bowed very low. ¡°I shall give the councillors your regrets, my lord.¡±
   ¡°No, damn it,¡± Ned said. It would not do to offend the council before he had even begun. ¡°I will see them. Pray give me a few moments to change into something more presentable.¡±
   ¡°Yes, my lord,¡± the steward said. ¡°We have given you Lord Arryn¡¯s former chambers in the Tower of the Hand, if it please you. I shall have your things taken there.¡±
   ¡°My thanks,¡± Ned said as he ripped off his riding gloves and tucked them into his belt. The rest of his household was coming through the gate behind him. Ned saw Vayon Poole, his own steward, and called out. ¡°It seems the council has urgent need of me. See that my daughters find their bedchambers, and tell Jory to keep them there. Arya is not to go exploring.¡± Poole bowed. Ned turned back to the royal steward. ¡°My wagons are still straggling through the city. I shall need appropriate garments.¡±
   ¡°It will be my great pleasure,¡± the steward said.
   And so Ned had come striding into the council chambers, bone-tired and dressed in borrowed clothing, to find four members of the small council waiting for him.
   The chamber was richly furnished. Myrish carpets covered the floor instead of rushes, and in one corner a hundred fabulous beasts cavorted in bright paints on a carved screen from the Summer Isles. The walls were hung with tapestries from Norvos and Qohor and Lys, and a pair of Valyrian sphinxes flanked the door, eyes of polished garnet smoldering in black marble faces.
   The councillor Ned liked least, the eunuch Varys, accosted him the moment he entered. ¡°Lord Stark, I was grievous sad to hear about your troubles on the kingsroad. We have all been visiting the sept to light candles for Prince Joffrey. I pray for his recovery.¡± His hand left powder stains on Ned¡¯s sleeve, and he smelled as foul and sweet as flowers on a grave.
   ¡°Your gods have heard you,¡± Ned replied, cool yet polite. ¡°The prince grows stronger every day.¡± He disentangled himself from the eunuch¡¯s grip and crossed the room to where Lord Renly stood by the screen, talking quietly with a short man who could only be Littlefinger. Renly had been a boy of eight when Robert won the throne, but he had grown into a man so like his brother that Ned found it disconcerting. Whenever he saw him, it was as if the years had slipped away and Robert stood before him, fresh from his victory on the Trident.
   ¡°I see you have arrived safely, Lord Stark,¡± Renly said.
   ¡°And you as well,¡± Ned replied. ¡°You must forgive me, but sometimes you look the very image of your brother Robert.¡±
   ¡°A poor copy,¡± Renly said with a shrug.
   ¡°Though much better dressed,¡± Littlefinger quipped. ¡°Lord Renly spends more on clothing than half the ladies of the court.¡±
   It was true enough. Lord Renly was in dark green velvet, with a dozen golden stags embroidered on his doublet. A cloth-of-gold half cape was draped casually across one shoulder, fastened with an emerald brooch. ¡°There are worse crimes,¡± Renly said with a laugh. ¡°The way you dress, for one.¡±
   Littlefinger ignored the jibe. He eyed Ned with a smile on his lips that bordered on insolence. ¡°I have hoped to meet you for some years, Lord Stark. No doubt Lady Catelyn has mentioned me to you.¡±
   ¡°She has,¡± Ned replied with a chill in his voice. The sly arrogance of the comment rankled him. ¡°I understand you knew my brother Brandon as well.¡±
   Renly Baratheon laughed. Varys shuffled over to listen.
   ¡°Rather too well,¡± Littlefinger said. ¡°I still carry a token of his esteem. Did Brandon speak of me too?¡±
   ¡°Often, and with some heat,¡± Ned said, hoping that would end it. He had no patience with this game they played, this dueling with words.
   ¡°I should have thought that heat ill suits you Starks,¡± Littlefinger said. ¡°Here in the south, they say you are all made of ice, and melt when you ride below the Neck.¡±
   ¡°I do not plan on melting soon, Lord Baelish. You may count on it.¡± Ned moved to the council table and said, ¡°Maester Pycelle, I trust you are well.¡±
   The Grand Maester smiled gently from his tall chair at the foot of the table. ¡°Well enough for a man of my years, my lord,¡± he replied, ¡°yet I do tire easily, I fear.¡± Wispy strands of white hair fringed the broad bald dome of his forehead above a kindly face. His maester¡¯s collar was no simple metal choker such as Luwin wore, but two dozen heavy chains wound together into a ponderous metal necklace that covered him from throat to breast. The links were forged of every metal known to man: black iron and red gold, bright copper and dull lead, steel and tin and pale silver, brass and bronze and platinum. Garnets and amethysts and black pearls adorned the metalwork, and here and there an emerald or ruby. ¡°Perhaps we might begin soon,¡± the Grand Maester said, hands knitting together atop his broad stomach. ¡°I fear I shall fall asleep if we wait much longer.¡±
   ¡°As you will.¡± The king¡¯s seat sat empty at the head of the table, the crowned stag of Baratheon embroidered in gold thread on its pillows. Ned took the chair beside it, as the right hand of his king. ¡°My lords,¡± he said formally, ¡°I am sorry to have kept you waiting.¡±
   ¡°You are the King¡¯s Hand,¡± Varys said. ¡°We serve at your pleasure, Lord Stark.¡±
   As the others took their accustomed seats, it struck Eddard Stark forcefully that he did not belong here, in this room, with these men. He remembered what Robert had told him in the crypts below Winterfell. I am surrounded by flatterers and fools, the king had insisted. Ned looked down the council table and wondered which were the flatterers and which the fools. He thought he knew already. ¡°We are but five,¡± he pointed out.
   ¡°Lord Stannis took himself to Dragonstone not long after the king went north,¡± Varys said, ¡°and our gallant Ser Barristan no doubt rides beside the king as he makes his way through the city, as befits the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard.¡±
   ¡°Perhaps we had best wait for Ser Barristan and the king to join us,¡± Ned suggested.
   Renly Baratheon laughed aloud. ¡°If we wait for my brother to grace us with his royal presence, it could be a long sit.¡±
   ¡°Our good King Robert has many cares,¡± Varys said. ¡°He entrusts some small matters to us, to lighten his load.¡±
   ¡°What Lord Varys means is that all this business of coin and crops and justice bores my royal brother to tears,¡± Lord Renly said, ¡°so it falls to us to govern the realm. He does send us a command from time to time.¡± He drew a tightly rolled paper from his sleeve and laid it on the table. ¡°This morning he commanded me to ride ahead with all haste and ask Grand Maester Pycelle to convene this council at once. He has an urgent task for us.¡±
   Littlefinger smiled and handed the paper to Ned. It bore the royal seal. Ned broke the wax with his thumb and flattened the letter to consider the king¡¯s urgent command, reading the words with mounting disbelief. Was there no end to Robert¡¯s folly? And to do this in his name, that was salt in the wound. ¡°Gods be good,¡± he swore.
   ¡°What Lord Eddard means to say,¡± Lord Renly announced, ¡°is that His Grace instructs us to stage a great tournament in honor of his appointment as the Hand of the King.¡±
   ¡°How much?¡± asked Littlefinger, mildly.
   Ned read the answer off the letter. ¡°Forty thousand golden dragons to the champion. Twenty thousand to the man who comes second, another twenty to the winner of the melee, and ten thousand to the victor of the archery competition.¡±
   ¡°Ninety thousand gold pieces,¡± Littlefinger sighed. ¡°And we must not neglect the other costs. Robert will want a prodigious feast. That means cooks, carpenters, serving girls, singers, jugglers, fools?.?.?.?¡±
   ¡°Fools we have in plenty,¡± Lord Renly said.
   Grand Maester Pycelle looked to Littlefinger and asked, ¡°Will the treasury bear the expense?¡±
   ¡°What treasury is that?¡± Littlefinger replied with a twist of his mouth. ¡°Spare me the foolishness, Maester. You know as well as I that the treasury has been empty for years. I shall have to borrow the money. No doubt the Lannisters will be accommodating. We owe Lord Tywin some three million dragons at present, what matter another hundred thousand?¡±
   Ned was stunned. ¡°Are you claiming that the Crown is three million gold pieces in debt?¡±
   ¡°The Crown is more than six million gold pieces in debt, Lord Stark. The Lannisters are the biggest part of it, but we have also borrowed from Lord Tyrell, the Iron Bank of Braavos, and several Tyroshi trading cartels. Of late I¡¯ve had to turn to the Faith. The High Septon haggles worse than a Dornish fishmonger.¡±
   Ned was aghast. ¡°Aerys Targaryen left a treasury flowing with gold. How could you let this happen?¡±
   Littlefinger gave a shrug. ¡°The master of coin finds the money. The king and the Hand spend it.¡±
   ¡°I will not believe that Jon Arryn allowed Robert to beggar the realm,¡± Ned said hotly.
   Grand Maester Pycelle shook his great bald head, his chains clinking softly. ¡°Lord Arryn was a prudent man, but I fear that His Grace does not always listen to wise counsel.¡±
   ¡°My royal brother loves tournaments and feasts,¡± Renly Baratheon said, ¡°and he loathes what he calls ¡®counting coppers.¡¯ ¡±
   ¡°I will speak with His Grace,¡± Ned said. ¡°This tourney is an extravagance the realm cannot afford.¡±
   ¡°Speak to him as you will,¡± Lord Renly said, ¡°we had still best make our plans.¡±
   ¡°Another day,¡± Ned said. Perhaps too sharply, from the looks they gave him. He would have to remember that he was no longer in Winterfell, where only the king stood higher; here, he was but first among equals. ¡°Forgive me, my lords,¡± he said in a softer tone. ¡°I am tired. Let us call a halt for today and resume when we are fresher.¡± He did not ask for their consent, but stood abruptly, nodded at them all, and made for the door.
   Outside, wagons and riders were still pouring through the castle gates, and the yard was a chaos of mud and horseflesh and shouting men. The king had not yet arrived, he was told. Since the ugliness on the Trident, the Starks and their household had ridden well ahead of the main column, the better to separate themselves from the Lannisters and the growing tension. Robert had hardly been seen; the talk was he was traveling in the huge wheelhouse, drunk as often as not. If so, he might be hours behind, but he would still be here too soon for Ned¡¯s liking. He had only to look at Sansa¡¯s face to feel the rage twisting inside him once again. The last fortnight of their journey had been a misery. Sansa blamed Arya and told her that it should have been Nymeria who died. And Arya was lost after she heard what had happened to her butcher¡¯s boy. Sansa cried herself to sleep, Arya brooded silently all day long, and Eddard Stark dreamed of a frozen hell reserved for the Starks of Winterfell.
   He crossed the outer yard, passed under a portcullis into the inner bailey, and was walking toward what he thought was the Tower of the Hand when Littlefinger appeared in front of him. ¡°You¡¯re going the wrong way, Stark. Come with me.¡±
   Hesitantly, Ned followed. Littlefinger led him into a tower, down a stair, across a small sunken courtyard, and along a deserted corridor where empty suits of armor stood sentinel along the walls. They were relics of the Targaryens, black steel with dragon scales cresting their helms, now dusty and forgotten. ¡°This is not the way to my chambers,¡± Ned said.
   ¡°Did I say it was? I¡¯m leading you to the dungeons to slit your throat and seal your corpse up behind a wall,¡± Littlefinger replied, his voice dripping with sarcasm. ¡°We have no time for this, Stark. Your wife awaits.¡±
   ¡°What game are you playing, Littlefinger? Catelyn is at Winterfell, hundreds of leagues from here.¡±
   ¡°Oh?¡± Littlefinger¡¯s grey-green eyes glittered with amusement. ¡°Then it appears someone has managed an astonishing impersonation. For the last time, come. Or don¡¯t come, and I¡¯ll keep her for myself.¡± He hurried down the steps.
   Ned followed him warily, wondering if this day would ever end. He had no taste for these intrigues, but he was beginning to realize that they were meat and mead to a man like Littlefinger.
   At the foot of the steps was a heavy door of oak and iron. Petyr Baelish lifted the crossbar and gestured Ned through. They stepped out into the ruddy glow of dusk, on a rocky bluff high above the river. ¡°We¡¯re outside the castle,¡± Ned said.
   ¡°You are a hard man to fool, Stark,¡± Littlefinger said with a smirk. ¡°Was it the sun that gave it away, or the sky? Follow me. There are niches cut in the rock. Try not to fall to your death, Catelyn would never understand.¡± With that, he was over the side of the cliff, descending as quick as a monkey.
   Ned studied the rocky face of the bluff for a moment, then followed more slowly. The niches were there, as Littlefinger had promised, shallow cuts that would be invisible from below, unless you knew just where to look for them. The river was a long, dizzying distance below. Ned kept his face pressed to the rock and tried not to look down any more often than he had to.
   When at last he reached the bottom, a narrow, muddy trail along the water¡¯s edge, Littlefinger was lazing against a rock and eating an apple. He was almost down to the core. ¡°You are growing old and slow, Stark,¡± he said, flipping the apple casually into the rushing water. ¡°No matter, we ride the rest of the way.¡± He had two horses waiting. Ned mounted up and trotted behind him, down the trail and into the city.
   Finally Baelish drew rein in front of a ramshackle building, three stories, timbered, its windows bright with lamplight in the gathering dusk. The sounds of music and raucous laughter drifted out and floated over the water. Beside the door swung an ornate oil lamp on a heavy chain, with a globe of leaded red glass.
   Ned Stark dismounted in a fury. ¡°A brothel,¡± he said as he seized Littlefinger by the shoulder and spun him around. ¡°You¡¯ve brought me all this way to take me to a brothel.¡±
   ¡°Your wife is inside,¡± Littlefinger said.
   It was the final insult. ¡°Brandon was too kind to you,¡± Ned said as he slammed the small man back against a wall and shoved his dagger up under the little pointed chin beard.
   ¡°My lord, no,¡± an urgent voice called out. ¡°He speaks the truth.¡± There were footsteps behind him.
   Ned spun, knife in hand, as an old white-haired man hurried toward them. He was dressed in brown roughspun, and the soft flesh under his chin wobbled as he ran. ¡°This is no business of yours,¡± Ned began; then, suddenly, the recognition came. He lowered the dagger, astonished. ¡°Ser Rodrik?¡±
   Rodrik Cassel nodded. ¡°Your lady awaits you upstairs.¡±
   Ned was lost. ¡°Catelyn is truly here? This is not some strange jape of Littlefinger¡¯s?¡± He sheathed his blade.
   ¡°Would that it were, Stark,¡± Littlefinger said. ¡°Follow me, and try to look a shade more lecherous and a shade less like the King¡¯s Hand. It would not do to have you recognized. Perhaps you could fondle a breast or two, just in passing.¡±
   They went inside, through a crowded common room where a fat woman was singing bawdy songs while pretty young girls in linen shifts and wisps of colored silk pressed themselves against their lovers and dandled on their laps. No one paid Ned the least bit of attention. Ser Rodrik waited below while Littlefinger led him up to the third floor, along a corridor, and through a door.
   Inside, Catelyn was waiting. She cried out when she saw him, ran to him, and embraced him fiercely.
   ¡°My lady,¡± Ned whispered in wonderment.
   ¡°Oh, very good,¡± said Littlefinger, closing the door. ¡°You recognized her.¡±
   ¡°I feared you¡¯d never come, my lord,¡± she whispered against his chest. ¡°Petyr has been bringing me reports. He told me of your troubles with Arya and the young prince. How are my girls?¡±
   ¡°Both in mourning, and full of anger,¡± he told her. ¡°Cat, I do not understand. What are you doing in King¡¯s Landing? What¡¯s happened?¡± Ned asked his wife. ¡°Is it Bran? Is he?.?.?.?¡±Dead was the word that came to his lips, but he could not say it.
   ¡°It is Bran, but not as you think,¡± Catelyn said.
   Ned was lost. ¡°Then how? Why are you here, my love? What is this place?¡±
   ¡°Just what it appears,¡± Littlefinger said, easing himself onto a window seat. ¡°A brothel. Can you think of a less likely place to find a Catelyn Tully?¡± He smiled. ¡°As it chances, I own this particular establishment, so arrangements were easily made. I am most anxious to keep the Lannisters from learning that Cat is here in King¡¯s Landing.¡±
   ¡°Why?¡± Ned asked. He saw her hands then, the awkward way she held them, the raw red scars, the stiffness of the last two fingers on her left. ¡°You¡¯ve been hurt.¡± He took her hands in his own, turned them over. ¡°Gods. Those are deep cuts?.?.?.?a gash from a sword or?.?.?.?how did this happen, my lady?¡±
   Catelyn slid a dagger out from under her cloak and placed it in his hand. ¡°This blade was sent to open Bran¡¯s throat and spill his life¡¯s blood.¡±
   Ned¡¯s head jerked up. ¡°But?.?.?.?who?.?.?.?why would?.?.?.?¡±
   She put a finger to his lips. ¡°Let me tell it all, my love. It will go faster that way. Listen.¡±
   So he listened, and she told it all, from the fire in the library tower to Varys and the guardsmen and Littlefinger. And when she was done, Eddard Stark sat dazed beside the table, the dagger in his hand. Bran¡¯s wolf had saved the boy¡¯s life, he thought dully. What was it that Jon had said when they found the pups in the snow? Your children were meant to have these pups, my lord. And he had killed Sansa¡¯s, and for what? Was it guilt he was feeling? Or fear? If the gods had sent these wolves, what folly had he done?
   Painfully, Ned forced his thoughts back to the dagger and what it meant. ¡°The Imp¡¯s dagger,¡± he repeated. It made no sense. His hand curled around the smooth dragonbone hilt, and he slammed the blade into the table, felt it bite into the wood. It stood mocking him. ¡°Why should Tyrion Lannister want Bran dead? The boy has never done him harm.¡±
   ¡°Do you Starks have nought but snow between your ears?¡± Littlefinger asked. ¡°The Imp would never have acted alone.¡±
   Ned rose and paced the length of the room. ¡°If the queen had a role in this or, gods forbid, the king himself?.?.?.?no, I will not believe that.¡± Yet even as he said the words, he remembered that chill morning on the barrowlands, and Robert¡¯s talk of sending hired knives after the Targaryen princess. He remembered Rhaegar¡¯s infant son, the red ruin of his skull, and the way the king had turned away, as he had turned away in Darry¡¯s audience hall not so long ago. He could still hear Sansa pleading, as Lyanna had pleaded once.
   ¡°Most likely the king did not know,¡± Littlefinger said. ¡°It would not be the first time. Our good Robert is practiced at closing his eyes to things he would rather not see.¡±
   Ned had no reply for that. The face of the butcher¡¯s boy swam up before his eyes, cloven almost in two, and afterward the king had said not a word. His head was pounding.
   Littlefinger sauntered over to the table, wrenched the knife from the wood. ¡°The accusation is treason either way. Accuse the king and you will dance with Ilyn Payne before the words are out of your mouth. The queen?.?.?.?if you can find proof, and if you can make Robert listen, then perhaps?.?.?.?¡±
   ¡°We have proof,¡± Ned said. ¡°We have the dagger.¡±
   ¡°This?¡± Littlefinger flipped the knife casually end over end. ¡°A sweet piece of steel, but it cuts two ways, my lord. The Imp will no doubt swear the blade was lost or stolen while he was at Winterfell, and with his hireling dead, who is there to give him the lie?¡± He tossed the knife lightly to Ned. ¡°My counsel is to drop that in the river and forget that it was ever forged.¡±
   Ned regarded him coldly. ¡°Lord Baelish, I am a Stark of Winterfell. My son lies crippled, perhaps dying. He would be dead, and Catelyn with him, but for a wolf pup we found in the snow. If you truly believe I could forget that, you are as big a fool now as when you took up sword against my brother.¡±
   ¡°A fool I may be, Stark?.?.?.?yet I¡¯m still here, while your brother has been moldering in his frozen grave for some fourteen years now. If you are so eager to molder beside him, far be it from me to dissuade you, but I would rather not be included in the party, thank you very much.¡±
   ¡°You would be the last man I would willingly include in any party, Lord Baelish.¡±
   ¡°You wound me deeply.¡± Littlefinger placed a hand over his heart. ¡°For my part, I always found you Starks a tiresome lot, but Cat seems to have become attached to you, for reasons I cannot comprehend. I shall try to keep you alive for her sake. A fool¡¯s task, admittedly, but I could never refuse your wife anything.¡±
   ¡°I told Petyr our suspicions about Jon Arryn¡¯s death,¡± Catelyn said. ¡°He has promised to help you find the truth.¡± 
   That was not news that Eddard Stark welcomed, but it was true enough that they needed help, and Littlefinger had been almost a brother to Cat once. It would not be the first time that Ned had been forced to make common cause with a man he despised. ¡°Very well,¡± he said, thrusting the dagger into his belt. ¡°You spoke of Varys. Does the eunuch know all of it?¡±
   ¡°Not from my lips,¡± Catelyn said. ¡°You did not wed a fool, Eddard Stark. But Varys has ways of learning things that no man could know. He has some dark art, Ned, I swear it.¡±
   ¡°He has spies, that is well known,¡± Ned said, dismissive.
   ¡°It is more than that,¡± Catelyn insisted. ¡°Ser Rodrik spoke to Ser Aron Santagar in all secrecy, yet somehow the Spider knew of their conversation. I fear that man.¡±
   Littlefinger smiled. ¡°Leave Lord Varys to me, sweet lady. If you will permit me a small obscenity, and where better for it, I hold the man¡¯s balls in the palm of my hand.¡± He cupped his fingers, smiling. ¡°Or would, if he were a man, or had any balls. You see, if the pie is opened, the birds begin to sing, and Varys would not like that. Were I you, I would worry more about the Lannisters and less about the eunuch.¡±
   Ned did not need Littlefinger to tell him that. He was thinking back to the day Arya had been found, to the look on the queen¡¯s face when she said, We have a wolf, so soft and quiet. He was thinking of the boy Mycah, of Jon Arryn¡¯s sudden death, of Bran¡¯s fall, of old mad Aerys Targaryen dying on the floor of his throne room while his life¡¯s blood dried on a golden blade. ¡°My lady,¡± he said, turning to Catelyn, ¡°there is nothing more you can do here. I want you to return to Winterfell at once. If there was one assassin, there could be others. Whoever ordered Bran¡¯s death will learn soon enough that the boy still lives.¡±
   ¡°I had hoped to see the girls?.?.?.?¡± Catelyn said.
   ¡°That would be most unwise,¡± Littlefinger put in. ¡°The Red Keep is full of curious eyes, and children talk.¡±
   ¡°He speaks truly, my love,¡± Ned told her. He embraced her. ¡°Take Ser Rodrik and ride for Winterfell. I will watch over the girls. Go home to our sons and keep them safe.¡±
   ¡°As you say, my lord.¡± Catelyn lifted her face, and Ned kissed her. Her maimed fingers clutched against his back with a desperate strength, as if to hold him safe forever in the shelter of her arms. 
   ¡°Would the lord and lady like the use of a bedchamber?¡± asked Littlefinger. ¡°I should warn you, Stark, we usually charge for that sort of thing around here.¡±
   ¡°A moment alone, that¡¯s all I ask,¡± Catelyn said.
   ¡°Very well.¡± Littlefinger strolled to the door. ¡°Don¡¯t be too long. It is past time the Hand and I returned to the castle, before our absence is noted.¡±
   Catelyn went to him and took his hands in her own. ¡°I will not forget the help you gave me, Petyr. When your men came for me, I did not know whether they were taking me to a friend or an enemy. I have found you more than a friend. I have found a brother I¡¯d thought lost.¡±
   Petyr Baelish smiled. ¡°I am desperately sentimental, sweet lady. Best not tell anyone. I have spent years convincing the court that I am wicked and cruel, and I should hate to see all that hard work go for naught.¡±
   Ned believed not a word of that, but he kept his voice polite as he said, ¡°You have my thanks as well, Lord Baelish.¡±
   ¡°Oh, now there¡¯s a treasure,¡± Littlefinger said, exiting.
   When the door had closed behind him, Ned turned back to his wife. ¡°Once you are home, send word to Helman Tallhart and Galbart Glover under my seal. They are to raise a hundred bowmen each and fortify Moat Cailin. Two hundred determined archers can hold the Neck against an army. Instruct Lord Manderly that he is to strengthen and repair all his defenses at White Harbor, and see that they are well manned. And from this day on, I want a careful watch kept over Theon Greyjoy. If there is war, we shall have sore need of his father¡¯s fleet.¡±
   ¡°War?¡± The fear was plain on Catelyn¡¯s face.
   ¡°It will not come to that,¡± Ned promised her, praying it was true. He took her in his arms again. ¡°The Lannisters are merciless in the face of weakness, as Aerys Targaryen learned to his sorrow, but they would not dare attack the north without all the power of the realm behind them, and that they shall not have. I must play out this fool¡¯s masquerade as if nothing is amiss. Remember why I came here, my love. If I find proof that the Lannisters murdered Jon Arryn?.?.?.?¡±
   He felt Catelyn tremble in his arms. Her scarred hands clung to him. ¡°If,¡± she said, ¡°what then, my love?¡±
   That was the most dangerous part, Ned knew. ¡°All justice flows from the king,¡± he told her. ¡°When I know the truth, I must go to Robert.¡± And pray that he is the man I think he is, he finished silently, and not the man I fear he has become.
   
   21£®TYRION
   Are you certain that you must leave us so soon?¡± the Lord Commander asked him.
   ¡°Past certain, Lord Mormont,¡± Tyrion replied. ¡°My brother Jaime will be wondering what has become of me. He may decide that you have convinced me to take the black.¡±
   ¡°Would that I could.¡± Mormont picked up a crab claw and cracked it in his fist. Old as he was, the Lord Commander still had the strength of a bear. ¡°You¡¯re a cunning man, Tyrion. We have need of men of your sort on the Wall.¡±
   Tyrion grinned. ¡°Then I shall scour the Seven Kingdoms for dwarfs and ship them all to you, Lord Mormont.¡± As they laughed, he sucked the meat from a crab leg and reached for another. The crabs had arrived from Eastwatch only this morning, packed in a barrel of snow, and they were succulent.
   Ser Alliser Thorne was the only man at table who did not so much as crack a smile. ¡°Lannister mocks us.¡±
   ¡°Only you, Ser Alliser,¡± Tyrion said. This time the laughter round the table had a nervous, uncertain quality to it.
   Thorne¡¯s black eyes fixed on Tyrion with loathing. ¡°You have a bold tongue for someone who is less than half a man. Perhaps you and I should visit the yard together.¡±
   ¡°Why?¡± asked Tyrion. ¡°The crabs are here.¡±
   The remark brought more guffaws from the others. Ser Alliser stood up, his mouth a tight line. ¡°Come and make your japes with steel in your hand.¡±
   Tyrion looked pointedly at his right hand. ¡°Why, I have steel in my hand, Ser Alliser, although it appears to be a crab fork. Shall we duel?¡± He hopped up on his chair and began poking at Thorne¡¯s chest with the tiny fork. Roars of laughter filled the tower room. Bits of crab flew from the Lord Commander¡¯s mouth as he began to gasp and choke. Even his raven joined in, cawing loudly from above the window. ¡°Duel! Duel! Duel!¡±
   Ser Alliser Thorne walked from the room so stiffly it looked as though he had a dagger up his butt.
   Mormont was still gasping for breath. Tyrion pounded him on the back. ¡°To the victor goes the spoils,¡± he called out. ¡°I claim Thorne¡¯s share of the crabs.¡±
   Finally the Lord Commander recovered himself. ¡°You are a wicked man, to provoke our Ser Alliser so,¡± he scolded.
   Tyrion seated himself and took a sip of wine. ¡°If a man paints a target on his chest, he should expect that sooner or later someone will loose an arrow at him. I have seen dead men with more humor than your Ser Alliser.¡±
   ¡°Not so,¡± objected the Lord Steward, Bowen Marsh, a man as round and red as a pomegranate. ¡°You ought to hear the droll names he gives the lads he trains.¡±
   Tyrion had heard a few of those droll names. ¡°I¡¯ll wager the lads have a few names for him as well,¡± he said. ¡°Chip the ice off your eyes, my good lords. Ser Alliser Thorne should be mucking out your stables, not drilling your young warriors.¡±
   ¡°The Watch has no shortage of stableboys,¡± Lord Mormont grumbled. ¡°That seems to be all they send us these days. Stableboys and sneak thieves and rapers. Ser Alliser is an anointed knight, one of the few to take the black since I have been Lord Commander. He fought bravely at King¡¯s Landing.¡±
   ¡°On the wrong side,¡± Ser Jaremy Rykker commented dryly. ¡°I ought to know, I was there on the battlements beside him. Tywin Lannister gave us a splendid choice. Take the black, or see our heads on spikes before evenfall. No offense intended, Tyrion.¡±
   ¡°None taken, Ser Jaremy. My father is very fond of spiked heads, especially those of people who have annoyed him in some fashion. And a face as noble as yours, well, no doubt he saw you decorating the city wall above the King¡¯s Gate. I think you would have looked very striking up there.¡±
   ¡°Thank you,¡± Ser Jaremy replied with a sardonic smile.
   Lord Commander Mormont cleared his throat. ¡°Sometimes I fear Ser Alliser saw you true, Tyrion. You do mock us and our noble purpose here.¡±
   Tyrion shrugged. ¡°We all need to be mocked from time to time, Lord Mormont, lest we start to take ourselves too seriously. More wine, please.¡± He held out his cup.
   As Rykker filled it for him, Bowen Marsh said, ¡°You have a great thirst for a small man.¡±
   ¡°Oh, I think that Lord Tyrion is quite a large man,¡± Maester Aemon said from the far end of the table. He spoke softly, yet the high officers of the Night¡¯s Watch all fell quiet, the better to hear what the ancient had to say. ¡°I think he is a giant come among us, here at the end of the world.¡±
   Tyrion answered gently, ¡°I¡¯ve been called many things, my lord, but giant is seldom one of them.¡±
   ¡°Nonetheless,¡± Maester Aemon said as his clouded, milk-white eyes moved to Tyrion¡¯s face, ¡°I think it is true.¡±
   For once, Tyrion Lannister found himself at a loss for words. He could only bow his head politely and say, ¡°You are too kind, Maester Aemon.¡±
   The blind man smiled. He was a tiny thing, wrinkled and hairless, shrunken beneath the weight of a hundred years so his maester¡¯s collar with its links of many metals hung loose about his throat. ¡°I have been called many things, my lord,¡± he said, ¡°but kind is seldom one of them.¡± This time Tyrion himself led the laughter.
   Much later, when the serious business of eating was done and the others had left, Mormont offered Tyrion a chair beside the fire and a cup of mulled spirits so strong they brought tears to his eyes. ¡°The kingsroad can be perilous this far north,¡± the Lord Commander told him as they drank.
   ¡°I have Jyck and Morrec,¡± Tyrion said, ¡°and Yoren is riding south again.¡±
   ¡°Yoren is only one man. The Watch shall escort you as far as Winterfell,¡± Mormont announced in a tone that brooked no argument. ¡°Three men should be sufficient.¡±
   ¡°If you insist, my lord,¡± Tyrion said. ¡°You might send young Snow. He would be glad for a chance to see his brothers.¡±
   Mormont frowned through his thick grey beard. ¡°Snow? Oh, the Stark bastard. I think not. The young ones need to forget the lives they left behind them, the brothers and mothers and all that. A visit home would only stir up feelings best left alone. I know these things. My own blood kin?.?.?.?my sister Maege rules Bear Island now, since my son¡¯s dishonor. I have nieces I have never seen.¡± He took a swallow. ¡°Besides, Jon Snow is only a boy. You shall have three strong swords, to keep you safe.¡±
   ¡°I am touched by your concern, Lord Mormont.¡± The strong drink was making Tyrion light-headed, but not so drunk that he did not realize that the Old Bear wanted something from him. ¡°I hope I can repay your kindness.¡±
   ¡°You can,¡± Mormont said bluntly. ¡°Your sister sits beside the king. Your brother is a great knight, and your father the most powerful lord in the Seven Kingdoms. Speak to them for us. Tell them of our need here. You have seen for yourself, my lord. The Night¡¯s Watch is dying. Our strength is less than a thousand now. Six hundred here, two hundred in the Shadow Tower, even fewer at Eastwatch, and a scant third of those fighting men. The Wall is a hundred leagues long. Think on that. Should an attack come, I have three men to defend each mile of wall.¡±
   ¡°Three and a third,¡± Tyrion said with a yawn.
   Mormont scarcely seemed to hear him. The old man warmed his hands before the fire. ¡°I sent Benjen Stark to search after Yohn Royce¡¯s son, lost on his first ranging. The Royce boy was green as summer grass, yet he insisted on the honor of his own command, saying it was his due as a knight. I did not wish to offend his lord father, so I yielded. I sent him out with two men I deemed as good as any in the Watch. More fool I.¡±
   ¡°Fool,¡± the raven agreed. Tyrion glanced up. The bird peered down at him with those beady black eyes, ruffling its wings. ¡°Fool,¡± it called again. Doubtless old Mormont would take it amiss if he throttled the creature. A pity.
   The Lord Commander took no notice of the irritating bird. ¡°Gared was near as old as I am and longer on the Wall,¡± he went on, ¡°yet it would seem he forswore himself and fled. I should never have believed it, not of him, but Lord Eddard sent me his head from Winterfell. Of Royce, there is no word. One deserter and two men lost, and now Ben Stark too has gone missing.¡± He sighed deeply. ¡°Who am I to send searching after him? In two years I will be seventy. Too old and too weary for the burden I bear, yet if I set it down, who will pick it up? Alliser Thorne? Bowen Marsh? I would have to be as blind as Maester Aemon not to see what they are. The Night¡¯s Watch has become an army of sullen boys and tired old men. Apart from the men at my table tonight, I have perhaps twenty who can read, and even fewer who can think, or plan, or lead. Once the Watch spent its summers building, and each Lord Commander raised the Wall higher than he found it. Now it is all we can do to stay alive.¡±
   He was in deadly earnest, Tyrion realized. He felt faintly embarrassed for the old man. Lord Mormont had spent a good part of his life on the Wall, and he needed to believe if those years were to have any meaning. ¡°I promise, the king will hear of your need,¡± Tyrion said gravely, ¡°and I will speak to my father and my brother Jaime as well.¡± And he would. Tyrion Lannister was as good as his word. He left the rest unsaid; that King Robert would ignore him, Lord Tywin would ask if he had taken leave of his senses, and Jaime would only laugh.
   ¡°You are a young man, Tyrion,¡± Mormont said. ¡°How many winters have you seen?¡±
   He shrugged. ¡°Eight, nine. I misremember.¡±
   ¡°And all of them short.¡±
   ¡°As you say, my lord.¡± He had been born in the dead of winter, a terrible cruel one that the maesters said had lasted near three years, but Tyrion¡¯s earliest memories were of spring.
   ¡°When I was a boy, it was said that a long summer always meant a long winter to come. This summer has lasted nine years, Tyrion, and a tenth will soon be upon us. Think on that.¡±
   ¡°When I was a boy,¡± Tyrion replied, ¡°my wet nurse told me that one day, if men were good, the gods would give the world a summer without ending. Perhaps we¡¯ve been better than we thought, and the Great Summer is finally at hand.¡± He grinned.
   The Lord Commander did not seem amused. ¡°You are not fool enough to believe that, my lord. Already the days grow shorter. There can be no mistake, Aemon has had letters from the Citadel, findings in accord with his own. The end of summer stares us in the face.¡± Mormont reached out and clutched Tyrion tightly by the hand. ¡°You must make them understand. I tell you, my lord, the darkness is coming. There are wild things in the woods, direwolves and mammoths and snow bears the size of aurochs, and I have seen darker shapes in my dreams.¡±
   ¡°In your dreams,¡± Tyrion echoed, thinking how badly he needed another strong drink.
   Mormont was deaf to the edge in his voice. ¡°The fisherfolk near Eastwatch have glimpsed white walkers on the shore.¡±
   This time Tyrion could not hold his tongue. ¡°The fisherfolk of Lannisport often glimpse merlings.¡±
   ¡°Denys Mallister writes that the mountain people are moving south, slipping past the Shadow Tower in numbers greater than ever before. They are running, my lord?.?.?.?but running from what?¡± Lord Mormont moved to the window and stared out into the night. ¡°These are old bones, Lannister, but they have never felt a chill like this. Tell the king what I say, I pray you. Winter is coming, and when the Long Night falls, only the Night¡¯s Watch will stand between the realm and the darkness that sweeps from the north. The gods help us all if we are not ready.¡±
   ¡°The gods help me if I do not get some sleep tonight. Yoren is determined to ride at first light.¡± Tyrion got to his feet, sleepy from wine and tired of doom. ¡°I thank you for all the courtesies you have done me, Lord Mormont.¡±
   ¡°Tell them, Tyrion. Tell them and make them believe. That is all the thanks I need.¡± He whistled, and his raven flew to him and perched on his shoulder. Mormont smiled and gave the bird some corn from his pocket, and that was how Tyrion left him.
   It was bitter cold outside. Bundled thickly in his furs, Tyrion Lannister pulled on his gloves and nodded to the poor frozen wretches standing sentry outside the Commander¡¯s Keep. He set off across the yard for his own chambers in the King¡¯s Tower, walking as briskly as his legs could manage. Patches of snow crunched beneath his feet as his boots broke the night¡¯s crust, and his breath steamed before him like a banner. He shoved his hands into his armpits and walked faster, praying that Morrec had remembered to warm his bed with hot bricks from the fire.
   Behind the King¡¯s Tower, the Wall glimmered in the light of the moon, immense and mysterious. Tyrion stopped for a moment to look up at it. His legs ached of cold and haste.
   Suddenly a strange madness took hold of him, a yearning to look once more off the end of the world. It would be his last chance, he thought; tomorrow he would ride south, and he could not imagine why he would ever want to return to this frozen desolation. The King¡¯s Tower was before him, with its promise of warmth and a soft bed, yet Tyrion found himself walking past it, toward the vast pale palisade of the Wall.
   A wooden stair ascended the south face, anchored on huge rough-hewn beams sunk deep into the ice and frozen in place. Back and forth it switched, clawing its way upward as crooked as a bolt of lightning. The black brothers assured him that it was much stronger than it looked, but Tyrion¡¯s legs were cramping too badly for him to even contemplate the ascent. He went instead to the iron cage beside the well, clambered inside, and yanked hard on the bell rope, three quick pulls.
   He had to wait what seemed an eternity, standing there inside the bars with the Wall to his back. Long enough for Tyrion to begin to wonder why he was doing this. He had just about decided to forget his sudden whim and go to bed when the cage gave a jerk and began to ascend.
   He moved upward slowly, by fits and starts at first, then more smoothly. The ground fell away beneath him, the cage swung, and Tyrion wrapped his hands around the iron bars. He could feel the cold of the metal even through his gloves. Morrec had a fire burning in his room, he noted with approval, but the Lord Commander¡¯s tower was dark. The Old Bear had more sense than he did, it seemed.
   Then he was above the towers, still inching his way upward. Castle Black lay below him, etched in moonlight. You could see how stark and empty it was from up here; windowless keeps, crumbling walls, courtyards choked with broken stone. Farther off, he could see the lights of Mole¡¯s Town, the little village half a league south along the kingsroad, and here and there the bright glitter of moonlight on water where icy streams descended from the mountain heights to cut across the plains. The rest of the world was a bleak emptiness of windswept hills and rocky fields spotted with snow.
   Finally a thick voice behind him said, ¡°Seven hells, it¡¯s the dwarf,¡± and the cage jerked to a sudden stop and hung there, swinging slowly back and forth, the ropes creaking.
   ¡°Bring him in, damn it.¡± There was a grunt and a loud groaning of wood as the cage slid sideways and then the Wall was beneath him. Tyrion waited until the swinging had stopped before he pushed open the cage door and hopped down onto the ice. A heavy figure in black was leaning on the winch, while a second held the cage with a gloved hand. Their faces were muffled in woolen scarves so only their eyes showed, and they were plump with layers of wool and leather, black on black. ¡°And what will you be wanting, this time of night?¡± the one by the winch asked.
   ¡°A last look.¡±
   The men exchanged sour glances. ¡°Look all you want,¡± the other one said. ¡°Just have a care you don¡¯t fall off, little man. The Old Bear would have our hides.¡± A small wooden shack stood under the great crane, and Tyrion saw the dull glow of a brazier and felt a brief gust of warmth when the winch men opened the door and went back inside. And then he was alone.
   It was bitingly cold up here, and the wind pulled at his clothes like an insistent lover. The top of the Wall was wider than the kingsroad often was, so Tyrion had no fear of falling, although the footing was slicker than he would have liked. The brothers spread crushed stone across the walkways, but the weight of countless footsteps would melt the Wall beneath, so the ice would seem to grow around the gravel, swallowing it, until the path was bare again and it was time to crush more stone.
   Still, it was nothing that Tyrion could not manage. He looked off to the east and west, at the Wall stretching before him, a vast white road with no beginning and no end and a dark abyss on either side. West, he decided, for no special reason, and he began to walk that way, following the pathway nearest the north edge, where the gravel looked freshest.
   His bare cheeks were ruddy with the cold, and his legs complained more loudly with every step, but Tyrion ignored them. The wind swirled around him, gravel crunched beneath his boots, while ahead the white ribbon followed the lines of the hills, rising higher and higher, until it was lost beyond the western horizon. He passed a massive catapult, as tall as a city wall, its base sunk deep into the Wall. The throwing arm had been taken off for repairs and then forgotten; it lay there like a broken toy, half-embedded in the ice.
   On the far side of the catapult, a muffled voice called out a challenge. ¡°Who goes there? Halt!¡±
   Tyrion stopped. ¡°If I halt too long I¡¯ll freeze in place, Jon,¡± he said as a shaggy pale shape slid toward him silently and sniffed at his furs. ¡°Hello, Ghost.¡±
   Jon Snow moved closer. He looked bigger and heavier in his layers of fur and leather, the hood of his cloak pulled down over his face. ¡°Lannister,¡± he said, yanking loose the scarf to uncover his mouth. ¡°This is the last place I would have expected to see you.¡± He carried a heavy spear tipped in iron, taller than he was, and a sword hung at his side in a leather sheath. Across his chest was a gleaming black warhorn, banded with silver.
   ¡°This is the last place I would have expected to be seen,¡± Tyrion admitted. ¡°I was captured by a whim. If I touch Ghost, will he chew my hand off?¡±
   ¡°Not with me here,¡± Jon promised.
   Tyrion scratched the white wolf behind the ears. The red eyes watched him impassively. The beast came up as high as his chest now. Another year, and Tyrion had the gloomy feeling he¡¯d be looking up at him. ¡°What are you doing up here tonight?¡± he asked. ¡°Besides freezing your manhood off ?.?.?.?¡±
   ¡°I have drawn night guard,¡± Jon said. ¡°Again. Ser Alliser has kindly arranged for the watch commander to take a special interest in me. He seems to think that if they keep me awake half the night, I¡¯ll fall asleep during morning drill. So far I have disappointed him.¡±
   Tyrion grinned. ¡°And has Ghost learned to juggle yet?¡±
   ¡°No,¡± said Jon, smiling, ¡°but Grenn held his own against Halder this morning, and Pyp is no longer dropping his sword quite so often as he did.¡±
   ¡°Pyp?¡±
   ¡°Pypar is his real name. The small boy with the large ears. He saw me working with Grenn and asked for help. Thorne had never even shown him the proper way to grip a sword.¡± He turned to look north. ¡°I have a mile of Wall to guard. Will you walk with me?¡±
   ¡°If you walk slowly,¡± Tyrion said.
   ¡°The watch commander tells me I must walk, to keep my blood from freezing, but he never said how fast.¡±
   They walked, with Ghost pacing along beside Jon like a white shadow. ¡°I leave on the morrow,¡± Tyrion said.
   ¡°I know.¡± Jon sounded strangely sad.
   ¡°I plan to stop at Winterfell on the way south. If there is any message that you would like me to deliver?.?.?.?¡±
   ¡°Tell Robb that I¡¯m going to command the Night¡¯s Watch and keep him safe, so he might as well take up needlework with the girls and have Mikken melt down his sword for horseshoes.¡±
   ¡°Your brother is bigger than me,¡± Tyrion said with a laugh. ¡°I decline to deliver any message that might get me killed.¡±
   ¡°Rickon will ask when I¡¯m coming home. Try to explain where I¡¯ve gone, if you can. Tell him he can have all my things while I¡¯m away, he¡¯ll like that.¡±
   People seemed to be asking a great deal of him today, Tyrion Lannister thought. ¡°You could put all this in a letter, you know.¡±
   ¡°Rickon can¡¯t read yet. Bran?.?.?.?¡± He stopped suddenly. ¡°I don¡¯t know what message to send to Bran. Help him, Tyrion.¡±
   ¡°What help could I give him? I am no maester, to ease his pain. I have no spells to give him back his legs.¡±
   ¡°You gave me help when I needed it,¡± Jon Snow said.
   ¡°I gave you nothing,¡± Tyrion said. ¡°Words.¡±
   ¡°Then give your words to Bran too.¡±
   ¡°You¡¯re asking a lame man to teach a cripple how to dance,¡± Tyrion said. ¡°However sincere the lesson, the result is likely to be grotesque. Still, I know what it is to love a brother, Lord Snow. I will give Bran whatever small help is in my power.¡±
   ¡°Thank you, my lord of Lannister.¡± He pulled off his glove and offered his bare hand. ¡°Friend.¡±
   Tyrion found himself oddly touched. ¡°Most of my kin are bastards,¡± he said with a wry smile, ¡°but you¡¯re the first I¡¯ve had to friend.¡± He pulled a glove off with his teeth and clasped Snow by the hand, flesh against flesh. The boy¡¯s grip was firm and strong.
   When he had donned his glove again, Jon Snow turned abruptly and walked to the low, icy northern parapet. Beyond him the Wall fell away sharply; beyond him there was only the darkness and the wild. Tyrion followed him, and side by side they stood upon the edge of the world.
   The Night¡¯s Watch permitted the forest to come no closer than half a mile of the north face of the Wall. The thickets of ironwood and sentinel and oak that had once grown there had been harvested centuries ago, to create a broad swath of open ground through which no enemy could hope to pass unseen. Tyrion had heard that elsewhere along the Wall, between the three fortresses, the wildwood had come creeping back over the decades, that there were places where grey-green sentinels and pale white weirwoods had taken root in the shadow of the Wall itself, but Castle Black had a prodigious appetite for firewood, and here the forest was still kept at bay by the axes of the black brothers.
   It was never far, though. From up here Tyrion could see it, the dark trees looming beyond the stretch of open ground, like a second wall built parallel to the first, a wall of night. Few axes had ever swung in that black wood, where even the moonlight could not penetrate the ancient tangle of root and thorn and grasping limb. Out there the trees grew huge, and the rangers said they seemed to brood and knew not men. It was small wonder the Night¡¯s Watch named it the haunted forest.
   As he stood there and looked at all that darkness with no fires burning anywhere, with the wind blowing and the cold like a spear in his guts, Tyrion Lannister felt as though he could almost believe the talk of the Others, the enemy in the night. His jokes of grumkins and snarks no longer seemed quite so droll.
   ¡°My uncle is out there,¡± Jon Snow said softly, leaning on his spear as he stared off into the darkness. ¡°The first night they sent me up here, I thought, Uncle Benjen will ride back tonight, and I¡¯ll see him first and blow the horn. He never came, though. Not that night and not any night.¡±
   ¡°Give him time,¡± Tyrion said.
   Far off to the north, a wolf began to howl. Another voice picked up the call, then another. Ghost cocked his head and listened. ¡°If he doesn¡¯t come back,¡± Jon Snow promised, ¡°Ghost and I will go find him.¡± He put his hand on the direwolf¡¯s head.
   ¡°I believe you,¡± Tyrion said, but what he thought was, And who will go find you? He shivered.
   
   22£®ARYA
   Her father had been fighting with the council again. Arya could see it on his face when he came to table, late again, as he had been so often. The first course, a thick sweet soup made with pumpkins, had already been taken away when Ned Stark strode into the Small Hall. They called it that to set it apart from the Great Hall, where the king could feast a thousand, but it was a long room with a high vaulted ceiling and bench space for two hundred at its trestle tables.
   ¡°My lord,¡± Jory said when Father entered. He rose to his feet, and the rest of the guard rose with him. Each man wore a new cloak, heavy grey wool with a white satin border. A hand of beaten silver clutched the woolen folds of each cloak and marked their wearers as men of the Hand¡¯s household guard. There were only fifty of them, so most of the benches were empty.
   ¡°Be seated,¡± Eddard Stark said. ¡°I see you have started without me. I am pleased to know there are still some men of sense in this city.¡± He signaled for the meal to resume. The servants began bringing out platters of ribs, roasted in a crust of garlic and herbs.
   ¡°The talk in the yard is we shall have a tourney, my lord,¡± Jory said as he resumed his seat. ¡°They say that knights will come from all over the realm to joust and feast in honor of your appointment as Hand of the King.¡±
   Arya could see that her father was not very happy about that. ¡°Do they also say this is the last thing in the world I would have wished?¡±
   Sansa¡¯s eyes had grown wide as the plates. ¡°A tourney,¡± she breathed. She was seated between Septa Mordane and Jeyne Poole, as far from Arya as she could get without drawing a reproach from Father. ¡°Will we be permitted to go, Father?¡±
   ¡°You know my feelings, Sansa. It seems I must arrange Robert¡¯s games and pretend to be honored for his sake. That does not mean I must subject my daughters to this folly.¡±
   ¡°Oh, please,¡± Sansa said. ¡°I want to see.¡±
   Septa Mordane spoke up. ¡°Princess Myrcella will be there, my lord, and her younger than Lady Sansa. All the ladies of the court will be expected at a grand event like this, and as the tourney is in your honor, it would look queer if your family did not attend.¡±
   Father looked pained. ¡°I suppose so. Very well, I shall arrange a place for you, Sansa.¡± He saw Arya. ¡°For both of you.¡±
   ¡°I don¡¯t care about their stupid tourney,¡± Arya said. She knew Prince Joffrey would be there, and she hated Prince Joffrey.
   Sansa lifted her head. ¡°It will be a splendid event. You shan¡¯t be wanted.¡±
   Anger flashed across Father¡¯s face. ¡°Enough, Sansa. More of that and you will change my mind. I am weary unto death of this endless war you two are fighting. You are sisters. I expect you to behave like sisters, is that understood?¡±
   Sansa bit her lip and nodded. Arya lowered her face to stare sullenly at her plate. She could feel tears stinging her eyes. She rubbed them away angrily, determined not to cry.
   The only sound was the clatter of knives and forks. ¡°Pray excuse me,¡± her father announced to the table. ¡°I find I have small appetite tonight.¡± He walked from the hall.
   After he was gone, Sansa exchanged excited whispers with Jeyne Poole. Down the table Jory laughed at a joke, and Hullen started in about h orseflesh. ¡°Your warhorse, now, he may not be the best one for the joust. Not the same thing, oh, no, not the same at all.¡± The men had heard it all before; Desmond, Jacks, and Hullen¡¯s son Harwin shouted him down together, and Porther called for more wine.
   No one talked to Arya. She didn¡¯t care. She liked it that way. She would have eaten her meals alone in her bedchamber if they let her. Sometimes they did, when Father had to dine with the king or some lord or the envoys from this place or that place. The rest of the time, they ate in his solar, just him and her and Sansa. That was when Arya missed her brothers most. She wanted to tease Bran and play with baby Rickon and have Robb smile at her. She wanted Jon to muss up her hair and call her ¡°little sister¡± and finish her sentences with her. But all of them were gone. She had no one left but Sansa, and Sansa wouldn¡¯t even talk to her unless Father made her.
   Back at Winterfell, they had eaten in the Great Hall almost half the time. Her father used to say that a lord needed to eat with his men, if he hoped to keep them. ¡°Know the men who follow you,¡± she heard him tell Robb once, ¡°and let them know you. Don¡¯t ask your men to die for a stranger.¡± At Winterfell, he always had an extra seat set at his own table, and every day a different man would be asked to join him. One night it would be Vayon Poole, and the talk would be coppers and bread stores and servants. The next time it would be Mikken, and her father would listen to him go on about armor and swords and how hot a forge should be and the best way to temper steel. Another day it might be Hullen with his endless horse talk, or Septon Chayle from the library, or Jory, or Ser Rodrik, or even Old Nan with her stories.
   Arya had loved nothing better than to sit at her father¡¯s table and listen to them talk. She had loved listening to the men on the benches too; to freeriders tough as leather, courtly knights and bold young squires, grizzled old men-at-arms. She used to throw snowballs at them and help them steal pies from the kitchen. Their wives gave her scones and she invented names for their babies and played monsters-and-maidens and hide-the-treasure and come-into-my-castle with their children. Fat Tom used to call her ¡°Arya Underfoot,¡± because he said that was where she always was. She¡¯d liked that a lot better than ¡°Arya Horseface.¡±
   Only that was Winterfell, a world away, and now everything was changed. This was the first time they had supped with the men since arriving in King¡¯s Landing. Arya hated it. She hated the sounds of their voices now, the way they laughed, the stories they told. They¡¯d been her friends, she¡¯d felt safe around them, but now she knew that was a lie. They¡¯d let the queen kill Lady, that was horrible enough, but then the Hound found Mycah. Jeyne Poole had told Arya that he¡¯d cut him up in so many pieces that they¡¯d given him back to the butcher in a bag, and at first the poor man had thought it was a pig they¡¯d slaughtered. And no one had raised a voice or drawn a blade or anything, not Harwin who always talked so bold, or Alyn who was going to be a knight, or Jory who was captain of the guard. Not even her father.
   ¡°He was my friend,¡± Arya whispered into her plate, so low that no one could hear. Her ribs sat there untouched, grown cold now, a thin film of grease congealing beneath them on the plate. Arya looked at them and felt ill. She pushed away from the table.
   ¡°Pray, where do you think you are going, young lady?¡± Septa Mordane asked.
   ¡°I¡¯m not hungry.¡± Arya found it an effort to remember her courtesies. ¡°May I be excused, please?¡± she recited stiffly.
   ¡°You may not,¡± the septa said. ¡°You have scarcely touched your food. You will sit down and clean your plate.¡±
   ¡°You clean it!¡± Before anyone could stop her, Arya bolted for the door as the men laughed and Septa Mordane called loudly after her, her voice rising higher and higher.
   Fat Tom was at his post, guarding the door to the Tower of the Hand. He blinked when he saw Arya rushing toward him and heard the septa¡¯s shouts. ¡°Here now, little one, hold on,¡± he started to say, reaching, but Arya slid between his legs and then she was running up the winding tower steps, her feet hammering on the stone while Fat Tom huffed and puffed behind her.
   Her bedchamber was the only place that Arya liked in all of King¡¯s Landing, and the thing she liked best about it was the door, a massive slab of dark oak with black iron bands. When she slammed that door and dropped the heavy crossbar, nobody could get into her room, not Septa Mordane or Fat Tom or Sansa or Jory or the Hound, nobody! She slammed it now.
   When the bar was down, Arya finally felt safe enough to cry.
   She went to the window seat and sat there, sniffling, hating them all, and herself most of all. It was all her fault, everything bad that had happened. Sansa said so, and Jeyne too.
   Fat Tom was knocking on her door. ¡°Arya girl, what¡¯s wrong?¡± he called out. ¡°You in there?¡±
   ¡°No!¡± she shouted. The knocking stopped. A moment later she heard him going away. Fat Tom was always easy to fool.
   Arya went to the chest at the foot of her bed. She knelt, opened the lid, and began pulling her clothes out with both hands, grabbing handfuls of silk and satin and velvet and wool and tossing them on the floor. It was there at the bottom of the chest, where she¡¯d hidden it. Arya lifted it out almost tenderly and drew the slender blade from its sheath.
   Needle.
   She thought of Mycah again and her eyes filled with tears. Her fault, her fault, her fault. If she had never asked him to play at swords with her?.?.?.?
   There was a pounding at her door, louder than before. ¡°Arya Stark, you open this door at once, do you hear me?¡±
   Arya spun around, with Needle in her hand. ¡°You better not come in here!¡± she warned. She slashed at the air savagely.
   ¡°The Hand will hear of this!¡± Septa Mordane raged.
   ¡°I don¡¯t care,¡± Arya screamed. ¡°Go away.¡±
   ¡°You will rue this insolent behavior, young lady, I promise you that.¡± Arya listened at the door until she heard the sound of the septa¡¯s receding footsteps.
   She went back to the window, Needle in hand, and looked down into the courtyard below. If only she could climb like Bran, she thought; she would go out the window and down the tower, run away from this horrible place, away from Sansa and Septa Mordane and Prince Joffrey, from all of them. Steal some food from the kitchens, take Needle and her good boots and a warm cloak. She could find Nymeria in the wild woods below the Trident, and together they¡¯d return to Winterfell, or run to Jon on the Wall. She found herself wishing that Jon was here with her now. Then maybe she wouldn¡¯t feel so alone.
   A soft knock at the door behind her turned Arya away from the window and her dreams of escape. ¡°Arya,¡± her father¡¯s voice called out. ¡°Open the door. We need to talk.¡±
   Arya crossed the room and lifted the crossbar. Father was alone. He seemed more sad than angry. That made Arya feel even worse. ¡°May I come in?¡± Arya nodded, then dropped her eyes, ashamed. Father closed the door. ¡°Whose sword is that?¡±
   ¡°Mine.¡± Arya had almost forgotten Needle, in her hand.
   ¡°Give it to me.¡±
   Reluctantly Arya surrendered her sword, wondering if she would ever hold it again. Her father turned it in the light, examining both sides of the blade. He tested the point with his thumb. ¡°A bravo¡¯s blade,¡± he said. ¡°Yet it seems to me that I know this maker¡¯s mark. This is Mikken¡¯s work.¡±
   Arya could not lie to him. She lowered her eyes.
   Lord Eddard Stark sighed. ¡°My nine-year-old daughter is being armed from my own forge, and I know nothing of it. The Hand of the King is expected to rule the Seven Kingdoms, yet it seems I cannot even rule my own household. How is it that you come to own a sword, Arya? Where did you get this?¡±
   Arya chewed her lip and said nothing. She would not betray Jon, not even to their father.
   After a while, Father said, ¡°I don¡¯t suppose it matters, truly.¡± He looked down gravely at the sword in his hands. ¡°This is no toy for children, least of all for a girl. What would Septa Mordane say if she knew you were playing with swords?¡±
   ¡°I wasn¡¯t playing,¡± Arya insisted. ¡°I hate Septa Mordane.¡±
   ¡°That¡¯s enough.¡± Her father¡¯s voice was curt and hard. ¡°The septa is doing no more than is her duty, though gods know you have made it a struggle for the poor woman. Your mother and I have charged her with the impossible task of making you a lady.¡±
   ¡°I don¡¯t want to be a lady!¡± Arya flared.
   ¡°I ought to snap this toy across my knee here and now, and put an end to this nonsense.¡±
   ¡°Needle wouldn¡¯t break,¡± Arya said defiantly, but her voice betrayed her words.
   ¡°It has a name, does it?¡± Her father sighed. ¡°Ah, Arya. You have a wildness in you, child. ¡®The wolf blood,¡¯ my father used to call it. Lyanna had a touch of it, and my brother Brandon more than a touch. It brought them both to an early grave.¡± Arya heard sadness in his voice; he did not often speak of his father, or of the brother and sister who had died before she was born. ¡°Lyanna might have carried a sword, if my lord father had allowed it. You remind me of her sometimes. You even look like her.¡±
   ¡°Lyanna was beautiful,¡± Arya said, startled. Everybody said so. It was not a thing that was ever said of Arya.
   ¡°She was,¡± Eddard Stark agreed, ¡°beautiful, and willful, and dead before her time.¡± He lifted the sword, held it out between them. ¡°Arya, what did you think to do with this?.?.?.?Needle? Who did you hope to skewer? Your sister? Septa Mordane? Do you know the first thing about sword fighting?¡±
   All she could think of was the lesson Jon had given her. ¡°Stick them with the pointy end,¡± she blurted out.
   Her father snorted back laughter. ¡°That is the essence of it, I suppose.¡±
   Arya desperately wanted to explain, to make him see. ¡°I was trying to learn, but?.?.?.?¡± Her eyes filled with tears. ¡°I asked Mycah to practice with me.¡± The grief came on her all at once. She turned away, shaking. ¡°I asked him,¡± she cried. ¡°It was my fault, it was me?.?.?.?¡±
   Suddenly her father¡¯s arms were around her. He held her gently as she turned to him and sobbed against his chest. ¡°No, sweet one,¡± he murmured. ¡°Grieve for your friend, but never blame yourself. You did not kill the butcher¡¯s boy. That murder lies at the Hound¡¯s door, him and the cruel woman he serves.¡±
   ¡°I hate them,¡± Arya confided, red-faced, sniffling. ¡°The Hound and the queen and the king and Prince Joffrey. I hate all of them. Joffrey lied, it wasn¡¯t the way he said. I hate Sansa too. She did remember, she just lied so Joffrey would like her.¡±
   ¡°We all lie,¡± her father said. ¡°Or did you truly think I¡¯d believe that Nymeria ran off?¡±
   Arya blushed guiltily. ¡°Jory promised not to tell.¡±
   ¡°Jory kept his word,¡± her father said with a smile. ¡°There are some things I do not need to be told. Even a blind man could see that wolf would never have left you willingly.¡±
   ¡°We had to throw rocks,¡± she said miserably. ¡°I told her to run, to go be free, that I didn¡¯t want her anymore. There were other wolves for her to play with, we heard them howling, and Jory said the woods were full of game, so she¡¯d have deer to hunt. Only she kept following, and finally we had to throw rocks. I hit her twice. She whined and looked at me and I felt so ¡¯shamed, but it was right, wasn¡¯t it? The queen would have killed her.¡±
   ¡°It was right,¡± her father said. ¡°And even the lie was?.?.?.?not without honor.¡± He¡¯d put Needle aside when he went to Arya to embrace her. Now he took the blade up again and walked to the window, where he stood for a moment, looking out across the courtyard. When he turned back, his eyes were thoughtful. He seated himself on the window seat, Needle across his lap. ¡°Arya, sit down. I need to try and explain some things to you.¡±
   She perched anxiously on the edge of her bed. ¡°You are too young to be burdened with all my cares,¡± he told her, ¡°but you are also a Stark of Winterfell. You know our words.¡±
   ¡°Winter is coming,¡± Arya whispered.
   ¡°The hard cruel times,¡± her father said. ¡°We tasted them on the Trident, child, and when Bran fell. You were born in the long summer, sweet one, you¡¯ve never known anything else, but now the winter is truly coming. Remember the sigil of our House, Arya.¡±
   ¡°The direwolf,¡± she said, thinking of Nymeria. She hugged her knees against her chest, suddenly afraid.
   ¡°Let me tell you something about wolves, child. When the snows fall and the white winds blow, the lone wolf dies, but the pack survives. Summer is the time for squabbles. In winter, we must protect one another, keep each other warm, share our strengths. So if you must hate, Arya, hate those who would truly do us harm. Septa Mordane is a good woman, and Sansa?.?.?.?Sansa is your sister. You may be as different as the sun and the moon, but the same blood flows through both your hearts. You need her, as she needs you?.?.?.?and I need both of you, gods help me.¡±
   He sounded so tired that it made Arya sad. ¡°I don¡¯t hate Sansa,¡± she told him. ¡°Not truly.¡± It was only half a lie.
   ¡°I do not mean to frighten you, but neither will I lie to you. We have come to a dark dangerous place, child. This is not Winterfell. We have enemies who mean us ill. We cannot fight a war among ourselves. This willfulness of yours, the running off, the angry words, the disobedience?.?.?.?at home, these were only the summer games of a child. Here and now, with winter soon upon us, that is a different matter. It is time to begin growing up.¡±
   ¡°I will,¡± Arya vowed. She had never loved him so much as she did in that instant. ¡°I can be strong too. I can be as strong as Robb.¡±
   He held Needle out to her, hilt first. ¡°Here.¡±
   She looked at the sword with wonder in her eyes. For a moment she was afraid to touch it, afraid that if she reached for it it would be snatched away again, but then her father said, ¡°Go on, it¡¯s yours,¡± and she took it in her hand.
   ¡°I can keep it?¡± she said. ¡°For true?¡±
   ¡°For true.¡± He smiled. ¡°If I took it away, no doubt I¡¯d find a morningstar hidden under your pillow within the fortnight. Try not to stab your sister, whatever the provocation.¡±
   ¡°I won¡¯t. I promise.¡± Arya clutched Needle tightly to her chest as her father took his leave.
   The next morning, as they broke their fast, she apologized to Septa Mordane and asked for her pardon. The septa peered at her suspiciously, but Father nodded.
   Three days later, at midday, her father¡¯s steward Vayon Poole sent Arya to the Small Hall. The trestle tables had been dismantled and the benches shoved against the walls. The hall seemed empty, until an unfamiliar voice said, ¡°You are late, boy.¡± A slight man with a bald head and a great beak of a nose stepped out of the shadows, holding a pair of slender wooden swords. ¡°Tomorrow you will be here at midday.¡± He had an accent, the lilt of the Free Cities, Bravos perhaps, or Myr.
   ¡°Who are you?¡± Arya asked.
   ¡°I am your dancing master.¡± He tossed her one of the wooden blades. She grabbed for it, missed, and heard it clatter to the floor. ¡°Tomorrow you will catch it. Now pick it up.¡±
   It was not just a stick, but a true wooden sword complete with grip and guard and pommel. Arya picked it up and clutched it nervously with both hands, holding it out in front of her. It was heavier than it looked, much heavier than Needle.
   The bald man clicked his teeth together. ¡°That is not the way, boy. This is not a greatsword that is needing two hands to swing it. You will take the blade in one hand.¡±
   ¡°It¡¯s too heavy,¡± Arya said.
   ¡°It is heavy as it needs to be to make you strong, and for the balancing. A hollow inside is filled with lead, just so. One hand now is all that is needing.¡±
   Arya took her right hand off the grip and wiped her sweaty palm on her pants. She held the sword in her left hand. He seemed to approve. ¡°The left is good. All is reversed, it will make your enemies more awkward. Now you are standing wrong. Turn your body sideface, yes, so. You are skinny as the shaft of a spear, do you know. That is good too, the target is smaller. Now the grip. Let me see.¡± He moved closer and peered at her hand, prying her fingers apart, rearranging them. ¡°Just so, yes. Do not squeeze it so tight, no, the grip must be deft, delicate.¡±
   ¡°What if I drop it?¡± Arya said.
   ¡°The steel must be part of your arm,¡± the bald man told her. ¡°Can you drop part of your arm? No. Nine years Syrio Forel was first sword to the Sealord of Braavos, he knows these things. Listen to him, boy.¡±
   It was the third time he had called her ¡°boy.¡± ¡°I¡¯m a girl,¡± Arya objected.
   ¡°Boy, girl,¡± Syrio Forel said. ¡°You are a sword, that is all.¡± He clicked his teeth together. ¡°Just so, that is the grip. You are not holding a battle-axe, you are holding a...¡±
   ¡°...needle,¡± Arya finished for him, fiercely.
   ¡°Just so. Now we will begin the dance. Remember, child, this is not the iron dance of Westeros we are learning, the knight¡¯s dance, hacking and hammering, no. This is the bravo¡¯s dance, the water dance, swift and sudden. All men are made of water, do you know this? When you pierce them, the water leaks out and they die.¡± He took a step backward, raised his own wooden blade. ¡°Now you will try to strike me.¡±
   Arya tried to strike him. She tried for four hours, until every muscle in her body was sore and aching, while Syrio Forel clicked his teeth together and told her what to do.
   The next day their real work began.

   The Dothraki sea,¡± Ser Jorah Mormont said as he reined to a halt beside her on the top of the ridge. beneath them, the plain stretched out immense and empty, a vast flat expanse that reached to the distant horizon and beyond. It was a sea, Dany thought. Past here, there were no hills, no mountains, no trees nor cities nor roads, only the endless grasses, the tall blades rippling like waves when the winds blew. ¡°It¡¯s so green,¡± she said.
   ¡°Here and now,¡± Ser Jorah agreed. ¡°You ought to see it when it blooms, all dark red flowers from horizon to horizon, like a sea of blood. Come the dry season, and the world turns the color of old bronze. And this is only hranna, child. There are a hundred kinds of grass out there, grasses as yellow as lemon and as dark as indigo, blue grasses and orange grasses and grasses like rainbows. Down in the Shadow Lands beyond Asshai, they say there are oceans of ghost grass, taller than a man on horseback with stalks as pale as milkglass. It murders all other grass and glows in the dark with the spirits of the damned. The Dothraki claim that someday ghost grass will cover the entire world, and then all life will end.¡±
   That thought gave Dany the shivers. ¡°I don¡¯t want to talk about that now,¡± she said. ¡°It¡¯s so beautiful here, I don¡¯t want to think about everything dying.¡±
   ¡°As you will, Khaleesi,¡± Ser Jorah said respectfully.
   She heard the sound of voices and turned to look behind her. She and Mormont had outdistanced the rest of their party, and now the others were climbing the ridge below them. Her handmaid Irri and the young archers of her khas were fluid as centaurs, but Viserys still struggled with the short stirrups and the flat saddle. Her brother was miserable out here. He ought never have come. Magister Illyrio had urged him to wait in Pentos, had offered him the hospitality of his manse, but Viserys would have none of it. He would stay with Drogo until the debt had been paid, until he had the crown he had been promised. ¡°And if he tries to cheat me, he will learn to his sorrow what it means to wake the dragon,¡± Viserys had vowed, laying a hand on his borrowed sword. Illyrio had blinked at that and wished him good fortune.
   Dany realized that she did not want to listen to any of her brother¡¯s complaints right now. The day was too perfect. The sky was a deep blue, and high above them a hunting hawk circled. The grass sea swayed and sighed with each breath of wind, the air was warm on her face, and Dany felt at peace. She would not let Viserys spoil it.
   ¡°Wait here,¡± Dany told Ser Jorah. ¡°Tell them all to stay. Tell them I command it.¡±
   The knight smiled. Ser Jorah was not a handsome man. He had a neck and shoulders like a bull, and coarse black hair covered his arms and chest so thickly that there was none left for his head. Yet his smiles gave Dany comfort. ¡°You are learning to talk like a queen, Daenerys.¡±
   ¡°Not a queen,¡± said Dany. ¡°A khaleesi.¡± She wheeled her horse about and galloped down the ridge alone.
   The descent was steep and rocky, but Dany rode fearlessly, and the joy and the danger of it were a song in her heart. All her life Viserys had told her she was a princess, but not until she rode her silver had Daenerys Targaryen ever felt like one.
   At first it had not come easy. The khalasar had broken camp the morning after her wedding, moving east toward Vaes Dothrak, and by the third day Dany thought she was going to die. Saddle sores opened on her bottom, hideous and bloody. Her thighs were chafed raw, her hands blistered from the reins, the muscles of her legs and back so wracked with pain that she could scarcely sit. By the time dusk fell, her handmaids would need to help her down from her mount.
   Even the nights brought no relief. Khal Drogo ignored her when they rode, even as he had ignored her during their wedding, and spent his evenings drinking with his warriors and bloodriders, racing his prize horses, watching women dance and men die. Dany had no place in these parts of his life. She was left to sup alone, or with Ser Jorah and her brother, and afterward to cry herself to sleep. Yet every night, some time before the dawn, Drogo would come to her tent and wake her in the dark, to ride her as relentlessly as he rode his stallion. He always took her from behind, Dothraki fashion, for which Dany was grateful; that way her lord husband could not see the tears that wet her face, and she could use her pillow to muffle her cries of pain. When he was done, he would close his eyes and begin to snore softly and Dany would lie beside him, her body bruised and sore, hurting too much for sleep.
   Day followed day, and night followed night, until Dany knew she could not endure a moment longer. She would kill herself rather than go on, she decided one night?.?.?.?
   Yet when she slept that night, she dreamt the dragon dream again. Viserys was not in it this time. There was only her and the dragon. Its scales were black as night, wet and slick with blood. Her blood, Dany sensed. Its eyes were pools of molten magma, and when it opened its mouth, the flame came roaring out in a hot jet. She could hear it singing to her, She opened her arms to the fire, embraced it, let it swallow her whole, let it cleanse her and temper her and scour her clean. She could feel her flesh sear and blacken and slough away, could feel her blood boil and turn to steam, and yet there was no pain. She felt strong and new and fierce.
   And the next day, strangely, she did not seem to hurt quite so much. It was as if the gods had heard her and taken pity. Even her handmaids noticed the change. ¡°Khaleesi,¡± Jhiqui said, ¡°what is wrong? Are you sick?¡±
   ¡°I was,¡± she answered, standing over the dragon¡¯s eggs that Illyrio had given her when she wed. She touched one, the largest of the three, running her hand lightly over the shelf. Black-and-scarlet, she thought, like the dragon in my dream. The stone felt strangely warm beneath her fingers?.?.?.?or was she still dreaming? She pulled her hand back nervously.
   From that hour onward, each day was easier than the one before it. Her legs grew stronger; her blisters burst and her hands grew callused; her soft thighs toughened, supple as leather.
   The khal had commanded the handmaid Irri to teach Dany to ride in the Dothraki fashion, but it was the filly who was her real teacher. The horse seemed to know her moods, as if they shared a single mind. With every passing day, Dany felt surer in her seat. The Dothraki were a hard and unsentimental people, and it was not their custom to name their animals, so Dany thought of her only as the silver. She had never loved anything so much.
   As the riding became less an ordeal, Dany began to notice the beauties of the land around her. She rode at the head of the khalasar with Drogo and his bloodriders, so she came to each country fresh and unspoiled. Behind them the great horde might tear the earth and muddy the rivers and send up clouds of choking dust, but the fields ahead of them were always green and verdant.
   They crossed the rolling hills of Norvos, past terraced farms and small villages where the townsfolk watched anxiously from atop white stucco walls. They forded three wide placid rivers and a fourth that was swift and narrow and treacherous, camped beside a high blue waterfall, skirted the tumbled ruins of a vast dead city where ghosts were said to moan among blackened marble columns. They raced down Valyrian roads a thousand years old and straight as a Dothraki arrow. For half a moon, they rode through the Forest of Qohor, where the leaves made a golden canopy high above them, and the trunks of the trees were as wide as city gates. There were great elk in that wood, and spotted tigers, and lemurs with silver fur and huge purple eyes, but all fled before the approach of the khalasar and Dany got no glimpse of them.
   By then her agony was a fading memory. She still ached after a long day¡¯s riding, yet somehow the pain had a sweetness to it now, and each morning she came willingly to her saddle, eager to know what wonders waited for her in the lands ahead. She began to find pleasure even in her nights, and if she still cried out when Drogo took her, it was not always in pain.
   At the bottom of the ridge, the grasses rose around her, tall and supple. Dany slowed to a trot and rode out onto the plain, losing herself in the green, blessedly alone. In the khalasar she was never alone. Khal Drogo came to her only after the sun went down, but her handmaids fed her and bathed her and slept by the door of her tent, Drogo¡¯s bloodriders and the men of her khas were never far, and her brother was an unwelcome shadow, day and night. Dany could hear him on the top of the ridge, his voice shrill with anger as he shouted at Ser Jorah. She rode on, submerging herself deeper in the Dothraki sea.
   The green swallowed her up. The air was rich with the scents of earth and grass, mixed with the smell of horseflesh and Dany¡¯s sweat and the oil in her hair. Dothraki smells. They seemed to belong here. Dany breathed it all in, laughing. She had a sudden urge to feel the ground beneath her, to curl her toes in that thick black soil. Swinging down from her saddle, she let the silver graze while she pulled off her high boots.
   Viserys came upon her as sudden as a summer storm, his horse rearing beneath him as he reined up too hard. ¡°You dare!¡± he screamed at her. ¡°You give commands to me? To me?¡± He vaulted off the horse, stumbling as he landed. His face was flushed as he struggled back to his feet. He grabbed her, shook her. ¡°Have you forgotten who you are? Look at you. Look at you!¡±
   Dany did not need to look. She was barefoot, with oiled hair, wearing Dothraki riding leathers and a painted vest given her as a bride gift. She looked as though she belonged here. Viserys was soiled and stained in city silks and ringmail.
   He was still screaming. ¡°You do not command the dragon. Do you understand? I am the Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, I will not hear orders from some horselord¡¯s slut, do you hear me?¡± His hand went under her vest, his fingers digging painfully into her breast. ¡°Do you hear me?¡±
   Dany shoved him away, hard.
   Viserys stared at her, his lilac eyes incredulous. She had never defied him. Never fought back. Rage twisted his features. He would hurt her now, and badly, she knew that.
   Crack.
   The whip made a sound like thunder. The coil took Viserys around the throat and yanked him backward. He went sprawling in the grass, stunned and choking. The Dothraki riders hooted at him as he struggled to free himself. The one with the whip, young Jhogo, rasped a question. Dany did not understand his words, but by then Irri was there, and Ser Jorah, and the rest of her khas. ¡°Jhogo asks if you would have him dead, Khaleesi, ¡° Irri said.
   ¡°No,¡± Dany replied. ¡°No.¡±
   Jhogo understood that. One of the others barked out a comment, and the Dothraki laughed. Irri told her, ¡°Quaro thinks you should take an ear to teach him respect.¡±
   Her brother was on his knees, his fingers digging under the leather coils, crying incoherently, struggling for breath. The whip was tight around his windpipe.
   ¡°Tell them I do not wish him harmed,¡± Dany said.
   Irri repeated her words in Dothraki. Jhogo gave a pull on the whip, yanking Viserys around like a puppet on a string. He went sprawling again, freed from the leather embrace, a thin line of blood under his chin where the whip had cut deep.
   ¡°I warned him what would happen, my lady,¡± Ser Jorah Mormont said. ¡°I told him to stay on the ridge, as you commanded.¡±
   ¡°I know you did,¡± Dany replied, watching Viserys. He lay on the ground, sucking in air noisily, red-faced and sobbing. He was a pitiful thing. He had always been a pitiful thing. Why had she never seen that before? There was a hollow place inside her where her fear had been.
   ¡°Take his horse,¡± Dany commanded Ser Jorah. Viserys gaped at her. He could not believe what he was hearing; nor could Dany quite believe what she was saying. Yet the words came. ¡°Let my brother walk behind us back to the khalasar.¡± Among the Dothraki, the man who does not ride was no man at all, the lowest of the low, without honor or pride. ¡°Let everyone see him as he is.¡±
   ¡°No!¡± Viserys screamed. He turned to Ser Jorah, pleading in the Common Tongue with words the horsemen would not understand. ¡°Hit her, Mormont. Hurt her. Your king commands it. Kill these Dothraki dogs and teach her.¡±
   The exile knight looked from Dany to her brother; she barefoot, with dirt between her toes and oil in her hair, he with his silks and steel. Dany could see the decision on his face. ¡°He shall walk, Khaleesi,¡± he said. He took her brother¡¯s horse in hand while Dany remounted her silver.
   Viserys gaped at him, and sat down in the dirt. He kept his silence, but he would not move, and his eyes were full of poison as they rode away. Soon he was lost in the tall grass. When they could not see him anymore, Dany grew afraid. ¡°Will he find his way back?¡± she asked Ser Jorah as they rode.
   ¡°Even a man as blind as your brother should be able to follow our trail,¡± he replied.
   ¡°He is proud. He may be too shamed to come back.¡±
   Jorah laughed. ¡°Where else should he go? If he cannot find the khalasar, the khalasar will most surely find him. It is hard to drown in the Dothraki sea, child.¡±
   Dany saw the truth of that. The khalasar was like a city on the march, but it did not march blindly. Always scouts ranged far ahead of the main column, alert for any sign of game or prey or enemies, while outriders guarded their flanks. They missed nothing, not here, in this land, the place where they had come from. These plains were a part of them?.?.?.?and of her, now.
   ¡°I hit him,¡± she said, wonder in her voice. Now that it was over, it seemed like some strange dream that she had dreamed. ¡°Ser Jorah, do you think?.?.?.?he¡¯ll be so angry when he gets back?.?.?.?She shivered. ¡°I woke the dragon, didn¡¯t I?¡±
   Ser Jorah snorted. ¡°Can you wake the dead, girl? Your brother Rhaegar was the last dragon, and he died on the Trident. Viserys is less than the shadow of a snake.¡±
   His blunt words startled her. It seemed as though all the things she had always believed were suddenly called into question. ¡°You?.?.?.? you swore him your sword?.?.?.?¡±
   ¡°That I did, girl,¡± Ser Jorah said. ¡°And if your brother is the shadow of a snake, what does that make his servants?¡± His voice was bitter.
   ¡°He is still the true king. He is?.?.?.?¡±
   Jorah pulled up his horse and looked at her. ¡°Truth now. Would you want to see Viserys sit a throne?¡±
   Dany thought about that. ¡°He would not be a very good king, would he?¡±
   ¡°There have been worse?.?.?.?but not many.¡± The knight gave his heels to his mount and started off again.
   Dany rode close beside him. ¡°Still,¡± she said, ¡°the common people are waiting for him. Magister Illyrio says they are sewing dragon banners and praying for Viserys to return from across the narrow sea to free them.¡±
   ¡°The common people pray for rain, healthy children, and a summer that never ends,¡± Ser Jorah told her. ¡°It is no matter to them if the high lords play their game of thrones, so long as they are left in peace.¡± He gave a shrug. ¡°They never are.¡±
   Dany rode along quietly for a time, working his words like a puzzle box. It went against everything that Viserys had ever told her to think that the people could care so little whether a true king or a usurper reigned over them. Yet the more she thought on Jorah¡¯s words, the more they rang of truth.
   ¡°What do you pray for, Ser Jorah?¡± she asked him.
   ¡°Home,¡± he said. His voice was thick with longing.
   ¡°I pray for home too,¡± she told him, believing it.
   Ser Jorah laughed. ¡°Look around you then, Khaleesi.¡±
   But it was not the plains Dany saw then. It was King¡¯s Landing and the great Red Keep that Aegon the Conqueror had built. It was Dragonstone where she had been born. In her mind¡¯s eye they burned with a thousand lights, a fire blazing in every window. In her mind¡¯s eye, all the doors were red.
   ¡°My brother will never take back the Seven Kingdoms,¡± Dany said. She had known that for a long time, she realized. She had known it all her life. Only she had never let herself say the words, even in a whisper, but now she said them for Jorah Mormont and all the world to hear.
   Ser Jorah gave her a measuring look. ¡°You think not.¡±
   ¡°He could not lead an army even if my lord husband gave him one,¡± Dany said. ¡°He has no coin and the only knight who follows him reviles him as less than a snake. The Dothraki make mock of his weakness. He will never take us home.¡±
   ¡°Wise child.¡± The knight smiled.
   ¡°I am no child,¡± she told him fiercely. Her heels pressed into the sides of her mount, rousing the silver to a gallop. Faster and faster she raced, leaving Jorah and Irri and the others far behind, the warm wind in her hair and the setting sun red on her face. By the time she reached the khalasar, it was dusk.
   The slaves had erected her tent by the shore of a spring-fed pool. She could hear rough voices from the woven grass palace on the hill. Soon there would be laughter, when the men of her khas told the story of what had happened in the grasses today. By the time Viserys came limping back among them, every man, woman, and child in the camp would know him for a walker. There were no secrets in the khalasar.
   Dany gave the silver over to the slaves for grooming and entered her tent. It was cool and dim beneath the silk. As she let the door flap close behind her, Dany saw a finger of dusty red light reach out to touch her dragon¡¯s eggs across the tent. For an instant a thousand droplets of scarlet flame swam before her eyes. She blinked, and they were gone.
   Stone, she told herself. They are only stone, even Illyrio said so, the dragons are all dead. She put her palm against the black egg, fingers spread gently across the curve of the shell. The stone was warm. Almost hot. ¡°The sun,¡± Dany whispered. ¡°The sun warmed them as they rode.¡±
   She commanded her handmaids to prepare her a bath. Doreah built a fire outside the tent, while Irri and Jhiqui fetched the big copper tub, another bride gift, from the packhorses and carried water from the pool. When the bath was steaming, Irri helped her into it and climbed in after her.
   ¡°Have you ever seen a dragon?¡± she asked as Irri scrubbed her back and Jhiqui sluiced sand from her hair. She had heard that the first dragons had come from the east, from the Shadow Lands beyond Asshai and the islands of the Jade Sea. Perhaps some were still living there, in realms strange and wild.
   ¡°Dragons are gone, Khaleesi,¡± Irri said.
   ¡°Dead,¡± agreed Jhiqui. ¡°Long and long ago.¡±
   Viserys had told her that the last Targaryen dragons had died no more than a century and a half ago, during the reign of Aegon III, who was called the Dragonbane. That did not seem so long ago to Dany. ¡°Everywhere?¡± she said, disappointed. ¡°Even in the east?¡± Magic had died in the west when the Doom fell on Valyria and the Lands of the Long Summer, and neither spell-forged steel nor stormsingers nor dragons could hold it back, but Dany had always heard that the east was different. It was said that manticores prowled the islands of the Jade Sea, that basilisks infested the jungles of Yi Ti, that spellsingers, warlocks, and aeromancers practiced their arts openly in Asshai, while shadow binders and blood mages worked terrible sorceries in the black of night. Why shouldn¡¯t there be dragons too?
   ¡°No dragon,¡± Irri said. ¡°Brave men kill them, for dragon terrible evil beasts. It is known.¡±
   ¡°It is known,¡± agreed Jhiqui.
   ¡°A trader from Qarth once told me that dragons came from the moon,¡± blond Doreah said as she warmed a towel over the fire. Jhiqui and Irri were of an age with Dany, Dothraki girls taken as slaves when Drogo destroyed their father¡¯s khalasar. Doreah was older, almost twenty. Magister Illyrio had found her in a pleasure house in Lys.
   Silvery-wet hair tumbled across her eyes as Dany turned her head, curious. ¡°The moon?¡±
   ¡°He told me the moon was an egg, Khaleesi,¡± the Lysene girl said. ¡°Once there were two moons in the sky, but one wandered too close to the sun and cracked from the heat. A thousand thousand dragons poured forth, and drank the fire of the sun. That is why dragons breathe flame. One day the other moon will kiss the sun too, and then it will crack and the dragons will return.¡±
   The two Dothraki girls giggled and laughed. ¡°You are foolish straw head slave,¡± Irri said. ¡°Moon is no egg. Moon is god, woman wife of sun. It is known.¡±
   ¡°It is known,¡± Jhiqui agreed.
   Dany¡¯s skin was flushed and pink when she climbed from the tub. Jhiqui laid her down to oil her body and scrape the dirt from her pores. Afterward Irri sprinkled her with spice flower and cinnamon. While Doreah brushed her hair until it shone like spun silver, she thought about the moon, and eggs, and dragons.
   Her supper was a simple meal of fruit and cheese and fry bread, with a jug of honeyed wine to wash it down. ¡°Doreah, stay and eat with me,¡± Dany commanded when she sent her other handmaids away. The Lysene girl had hair the color of honey, and eyes like the summer sky.
   She lowered those eyes when they were alone. ¡°You honor me, Khaleesi,¡± she said, but it was no honor, only service. Long after the moon had risen, they sat together, talking.
   That night, when Khal Drogo came, Dany was waiting for him. He stood in the door of her tent and looked at her with surprise. She rose slowly and opened her sleeping silks and let them fall to the ground. ¡°This night we must go outside, my lord,¡± she told him, for the Dothraki believed that all things of importance in a man¡¯s life must be done beneath the open sky.
   Khal Drogo followed her out into the moonlight, the bells in his hair tinkling softly. A few yards from her tent was a bed of soft grass, and it was there that Dany drew him down. When he tried to turn her over, she put a hand on his chest. ¡°No,¡± she said. ¡°This night I would look on your face.¡±
   There is no privacy in the heart of the khalasar. Dany felt the eyes on her as she undressed him, heard the soft voices as she did the things that Doreah had told her to do. It was nothing to her. Was she not khaleesi? His were the only eyes that mattered, and when she mounted him she saw something there that she had never seen before. She rode him as fiercely as ever she had ridden her silver, and when the moment of his pleasure came, Khal Drogo called out her name.
   They were on the far side of the Dothraki sea when Jhiqui brushed the soft swell of Dany¡¯s stomach with her fingers and said, ¡°Khaleesi, you are with child.¡±
   ¡°I know,¡± Dany told her.
   It was her fourteenth name day.
   
   24£®BRAN
   In the yard below, Rickon ran with the wolves.
   Bran watched from his window seat. Wherever the boy went, Grey Wind was there first, loping ahead to cut him off, until Rickon saw him, screamed in delight, and went pelting off in another direction. Shaggydog ran at his heels, spinning and snapping if the other wolves came too close. His fur had darkened until he was all black, and his eyes were green fire. Bran¡¯s Summer came last. He was silver and smoke, with eyes of yellow gold that saw all there was to see. Smaller than Grey Wind, and more wary. Bran thought he was the smartest of the litter. He could hear his brother¡¯s breathless laughter as Rickon dashed across the hard-packed earth on little baby legs.
   His eyes stung. He wanted to be down there, laughing and running. Angry at the thought, Bran knuckled away the tears before they could fall. His eighth name day had come and gone. He was almost a man grown now, too old to cry.
   ¡°It was just a lie,¡± he said bitterly, remembering the crow from his dream. ¡°I can¡¯t fly. I can¡¯t even run.¡±
   ¡°Crows are all liars,¡± Old Nan agreed, from the chair where she sat doing her needlework. ¡°I know a story about a crow.¡±
   ¡°I don¡¯t want any more stories,¡± Bran snapped, his voice petulant. He had liked Old Nan and her stories once. Before. But it was different now. They left her with him all day now, to watch over him and clean him and keep him from being lonely, but she just made it worse. ¡°I hate your stupid stories.¡±
   The old woman smiled at him toothlessly. ¡°My stories? No, my little lord, not mine. The stories are, before me and after me, before you too.¡±
   She was a very ugly old woman, Bran thought spitefully; shrunken and wrinkled, almost blind, too weak to climb stairs, with only a few wisps of white hair left to cover a mottled pink scalp. No one really knew how old she was, but his father said she¡¯d been called Old Nan even when he was a boy. She was the oldest person in Winterfell for certain, maybe the oldest person in the Seven Kingdoms. Nan had come to the castle as a wet nurse for a Brandon Stark whose mother had died birthing him. He had been an older brother of Lord Rickard, Bran¡¯s grandfather, or perhaps a younger brother, or a brother to Lord Rickard¡¯s father. Sometimes Old Nan told it one way and sometimes another. In all the stories the little boy died at three of a summer chill, but Old Nan stayed on at Winterfell with her own children. She had lost both her sons to the war when King Robert won the throne, and her grandson was killed on the walls of Pyke during Balon Greyjoy¡¯s rebellion. Her daughters had long ago married and moved away and died. All that was left of her own blood was Hodor, the simpleminded giant who worked in the stables, but Old Nan just lived on and on, doing her needlework and telling her stories.
   ¡°I don¡¯t care whose stories they are,¡± Bran told her, ¡°I hate them.¡± He didn¡¯t want stories and he didn¡¯t want Old Nan. He wanted his mother and father. He wanted to go running with Summer loping beside him. He wanted to climb the broken tower and feed corn to the crows. He wanted to ride his pony again with his brothers. He wanted it to be the way it had been before.
   ¡°I know a story about a boy who hated stories,¡± Old Nan said with her stupid little smile, her needles moving all the while, click click click, until Bran was ready to scream at her.
   It would never be the way it had been, he knew. The crow had tricked him into flying, but when he woke up he was broken and the world was changed. They had all left him, his father and his mother and his sisters and even his bastard brother Jon. His father had promised he would ride a real horse to King¡¯s Landing, but they¡¯d gone without him. Maester Luwin had sent a bird after Lord Eddard with a message, and another to Mother and a third to Jon on the Wall, but there had been no answers. ¡°Ofttimes the birds are lost, child,¡± the maester had told him. ¡°There¡¯s many a mile and many a hawk between here and King¡¯s Landing, the message may not have reached them.¡± Yet to Bran it felt as if they had all died while he had slept ?.?.?.?or perhaps Bran had died, and they had forgotten him. Jory and Ser Rodrik and Vayon Poole had gone too, and Hullen and Harwin and Fat Tom and a quarter of the guard.
   Only Robb and baby Rickon were still here, and Robb was changed. He was Robb the Lord now, or trying to be. He wore a real sword and never smiled. His days were spent drilling the guard and practicing his swordplay, making the yard ring with the sound of steel as Bran watched forlornly from his window. At night he closeted himself with Maester Luwin, talking or going over account books. Sometimes he would ride out with Hallis Mollen and be gone for days at a time, visiting distant holdfasts. Whenever he was away more than a day, Rickon would cry and ask Bran if Robb was ever coming back. Even when he was home at Winterfell, Robb the Lord seemed to have more time for Hallis Mollen and Theon Greyjoy than he ever did for his brothers.
   ¡°I could tell you the story about Brandon the Builder,¡± Old Nan said. ¡°That was always your favorite.¡±
   Thousands and thousands of years ago, Brandon the Builder had raised Winterfell, and some said the Wall. Bran knew the story, but it had never been his favorite. Maybe one of the other Brandons had liked that story. Sometimes Nan would talk to him as if he were her Brandon, the baby she had nursed all those years ago, and sometimes she confused him with his uncle Brandon, who was killed by the Mad King before Bran was even born. She had lived so long, Mother had told him once, that all the Brandon Starks had become one person in her head.
   ¡°That¡¯s not my favorite,¡± he said. ¡°My favorites were the scary ones.¡± He heard some sort of commotion outside and turned back to the window. Rickon was running across the yard toward the gatehouse, the wolves following him, but the tower faced the wrong way for Bran to see what was happening. He smashed a fist on his thigh in frustration and felt nothing.
   ¡°Oh, my sweet summer child,¡± Old Nan said quietly, ¡°what do you know of fear? Fear is for the winter, my little lord, when the snows fall a hundred feet deep and the ice wind comes howling out of the north. Fear is for the long night, when the sun hides its face for years at a time, and little children are born and live and die all in darkness while the direwolves grow gaunt and hungry, and the white walkers move through the woods.¡±
   ¡°You mean the Others,¡± Bran said querulously.
   ¡°The Others,¡± Old Nan agreed. ¡°Thousands and thousands of years ago, a winter fell that was cold and hard and endless beyond all memory of man. There came a night that lasted a generation, and kings shivered and died in their castles even as the swineherds in their hovels. Women smothered their children rather than see them starve, and cried, and felt their tears freeze on their cheeks.¡± Her voice and her needles fell silent, and she glanced up at Bran with pale, filmy eyes and asked, ¡°So, child. This is the sort of story you like?¡±
   ¡°Well,¡± Bran said reluctantly, ¡°yes, only?.?.?.?¡±
   Old Nan nodded. ¡°In that darkness, the Others came for the first time,¡± she said as her needles went click click click. ¡°They were cold things, dead things, that hated iron and fire and the touch of the sun, and every creature with hot blood in its veins. They swept over holdfasts and cities and kingdoms, felled heroes and armies by the score, riding their pale dead horses and leading hosts of the slain. All the swords of men could not stay their advance, and even maidens and suckling babes found no pity in them. They hunted the maids through frozen forests, and fed their dead servants on the flesh of human children.¡±
   Her voice had dropped very low, almost to a whisper, and Bran found himself leaning forward to listen.
   ¡°Now these were the days before the Andals came, and long before the women fled across the narrow sea from the cities of the Rhoyne, and the hundred kingdoms of those times were the kingdoms of the First Men, who had taken these lands from the children of the forest. Yet here and there in the fastness of the woods the children still lived in their wooden cities and hollow hills, and the faces in the trees kept watch. So as cold and death filled the earth, the last hero determined to seek out the children, in the hopes that their ancient magics could win back what the armies of men had lost. He set out into the dead lands with a sword, a horse, a dog, and a dozen companions. For years he searched, until he despaired of ever finding the children of the forest in their secret cities. One by one his friends died, and his horse, and finally even his dog, and his sword froze so hard the blade snapped when he tried to use it. And the Others smelled the hot blood in him, and came silent on his trail, stalking him with packs of pale white spiders big as hounds...¡±
   The door opened with a bang, and Bran¡¯s heart leapt up into his mouth in sudden fear, but it was only Maester Luwin, with Hodor looming in the stairway behind him. ¡°Hodor!¡± the stableboy announced, as was his custom, smiling hugely at them all.
   Maester Luwin was not smiling. ¡°We have visitors,¡± he announced, ¡°and your presence is required, Bran.¡±
   ¡°I¡¯m listening to a story now,¡± Bran complained.
   ¡°Stories wait, my little lord, and when you come back to them, why, there they are,¡± Old Nan said. ¡°Visitors are not so patient, and ofttimes they bring stories of their own.¡±
   ¡°Who is it?¡± Bran asked Maester Luwin.
   ¡°Tyrion Lannister, and some men of the Night¡¯s Watch, with word from your brother Jon. Robb is meeting with them now. Hodor, will you help Bran down to the hall?¡±
   ¡°Hodor!¡± Hodor agreed happily. He ducked to get his great shaggy head under the door. Hodor was nearly seven feet tall. It was hard to believe that he was the same blood as Old Nan. Bran wondered if he would shrivel up as small as his great-grandmother when he was old. It did not seem likely, even if Hodor lived to be a thousand.
   Hodor lifted Bran as easy as if he were a bale of hay, and cradled him against his massive chest. He always smelled faintly of horses, but it was not a bad smell. His arms were thick with muscle and matted with brown hair. ¡°Hodor,¡± he said again. Theon Greyjoy had once commented that Hodor did not know much, but no one could doubt that he knew his name. Old Nan had cackled like a hen when Bran told her that, and confessed that Hodor¡¯s real name was Walder. No one knew where ¡°Hodor¡± had come from, she said, but when he started saying it, they started calling him by it. It was the only word he had.
   They left Old Nan in the tower room with her needles and her memories. Hodor hummed tunelessly as he carried Bran down the steps and through the gallery, with Maester Luwin following behind, hurrying to keep up with the stableboy¡¯s long strides.
   Robb was seated in Father¡¯s high seat, wearing ringmail and boiled leather and the stern face of Robb the Lord. Theon Greyjoy and Hallis Mollen stood behind him. A dozen guardsmen lined the grey stone walls beneath tall narrow windows. In the center of the room the dwarf stood with his servants, and four strangers in the black of the Night¡¯s Watch. Bran could sense the anger in the hall the moment that Hodor carried him through the doors.
   ¡°Any man of the Night¡¯s Watch is welcome here at Winterfell for as long as he wishes to stay,¡± Robb was saying with the voice of Robb the Lord. His sword was across his knees, the steel bare for all the world to see. Even Bran knew what it meant to greet a guest with an unsheathed sword.
   ¡°Any man of the Night¡¯s Watch,¡± the dwarf repeated, ¡°but not me, do I take your meaning, boy?¡±
   Robb stood and pointed at the little man with his sword. ¡°I am the lord here while my mother and father are away, Lannister. I am not your boy.¡±
   ¡°If you are a lord, you might learn a lord¡¯s courtesy,¡± the little man replied, ignoring the sword point in his face. ¡°Your bastard brother has all your father¡¯s graces, it would seem.¡±
   ¡°Jon,¡± Bran gasped out from Hodor¡¯s arms.
   The dwarf turned to look at him. ¡°So it is true, the boy lives. I could scarce believe it. You Starks are hard to kill.¡±
   ¡°You Lannisters had best remember that,¡± Robb said, lowering his sword. ¡°Hodor, bring my brother here.¡±
   ¡°Hodor,¡± Hodor said, and he trotted forward smiling and set Bran in the high seat of the Starks, where the Lords of Winterfell had sat since the days when they called themselves the Kings in the North. The seat was cold stone, polished smooth by countless bottoms; the carved heads of direwolves snarled on the ends of its massive arms. Bran clasped them as he sat, his useless legs dangling. The great seat made him feel half a baby.
   Robb put a hand on his shoulder. ¡°You said you had business with Bran. Well, here he is, Lannister.¡±
   Bran was uncomfortably aware of Tyrion Lannister¡¯s eyes. One was black and one was green, and both were looking at him, studying him, weighing him. ¡°I am told you were quite the climber, Bran,¡± the little man said at last. ¡°Tell me, how is it you happened to fall that day?¡±
   ¡°I never,¡± Bran insisted. He never fell, never never never.
   ¡°The child does not remember anything of the fall, or the climb that came before it,¡± said Maester Luwin gently.
   ¡°Curious,¡± said Tyrion Lannister.
   ¡°My brother is not here to answer questions, Lannister,¡± Robb said curtly. ¡°Do your business and be on your way.¡±
   ¡°I have a gift for you,¡± the dwarf said to Bran. ¡°Do you like to ride, boy?¡±
   Maester Luwin came forward. ¡°My lord, the child has lost the use of his legs. He cannot sit a horse.¡±
   ¡°Nonsense,¡± said Lannister. ¡°With the right horse and the right saddle, even a cripple can ride.¡±
   The word was a knife through Bran¡¯s heart. He felt tears come unbidden to his eyes. ¡°I¡¯m not a cripple!¡±
   ¡°Then I am not a dwarf,¡± the dwarf said with a twist of his mouth. ¡°My father will rejoice to hear it.¡± Greyjoy laughed.
   ¡°What sort of horse and saddle are you suggesting?¡± Maester Luwin asked.
   ¡°A smart horse,¡± Lannister replied. ¡°The boy cannot use his legs to command the animal, so you must shape the horse to the rider, teach it to respond to the reins, to the voice. I would begin with an unbroken yearling, with no old training to be unlearned.¡± He drew a rolled paper from his belt. ¡°Give this to your saddler. He will provide the rest.¡±
   Maester Luwin took the paper from the dwarfs hand, curious as a small grey squirrel. He unrolled it, studied it. ¡°I see. You draw nicely, my lord. Yes, this ought to work. I should have thought of this myself.¡±
   ¡°It came easier to me, Maester. It is not terribly unlike my own saddles.¡±
   ¡°Will I truly be able to ride?¡± Bran asked. He wanted to believe them, but he was afraid. Perhaps it was just another lie. The crow had promised him that he could fly.
   ¡°You will,¡± the dwarf told him. ¡°And I swear to you, boy, on horseback you will be as tall as any of them.¡±
   Robb Stark seemed puzzled. ¡°Is this some trap, Lannister? What¡¯s Bran to you? Why should you want to help him?¡±
   ¡°Your brother Jon asked it of me. And I have a tender spot in my heart for cripples and bastards and broken things.¡± Tyrion Lannister placed a hand over his heart and grinned.
   The door to the yard flew open. Sunlight came streaming across the hall as Rickon burst in, breathless. The direwolves were with him. The boy stopped by the door, wide-eyed, but the wolves came on. Their eyes found Lannister, or perhaps they caught his scent. Summer began to growl first. Grey Wind picked it up. They padded toward the little man, one from the right and one from the left.
   ¡°The wolves do not like your smell, Lannister,¡± Theon Greyioy commented.
   ¡°Perhaps it¡¯s time I took my leave,¡± Tyrion said. He took a step backward?.?.?.?and Shaggydog came out of the shadows behind him, snarling. Lannister recoiled, and Summer lunged at him from the other side. He reeled away, unsteady on his feet, and Grey Wind snapped at his arm, teeth ripping at his sleeve and tearing loose a scrap of cloth.
   ¡°No!¡± Bran shouted from the high seat as Lannister¡¯s men reached for their steel. ¡°Summer, here. Summer, to me!¡±
   The direwolf heard the voice, glanced at Bran, and again at Lannister. He crept backward, away from the little man, and settled down below Bran¡¯s dangling feet.
   Robb had been holding his breath. He let it out with a sigh and called, ¡°Grey Wind.¡± His direwolf moved to him, swift and silent. Now there was only Shaggydog, rumbling at the small man, his eyes burning like green fire.
   ¡°Rickon, call him,¡± Bran shouted to his baby brother, and Rickon remembered himself and screamed, ¡°Home, Shaggy, home now.¡± The black wolf gave Lannister one final snarl and bounded off to Rickon, who hugged him tightly around the neck.
   Tyrion Lannister undid his scarf, mopped at his brow, and said in a flat voice, ¡°How interesting.¡±
   ¡°Are you well, my lord?¡± asked one of his men, his sword in hand. He glanced nervously at the direwolves as he spoke.
   ¡°My sleeve is torn and my breeches are unaccountably damp, but nothing was harmed save my dignity.¡±
   Even Robb looked shaken. ¡°The wolves?.?.?.?I don¡¯t know why they did that?.?.?.?¡±
   ¡°No doubt they mistook me for dinner.¡± Lannister bowed stiffly to Bran. ¡°I thank you for calling them off, young ser. I promise you, they would have found me quite indigestible. And now I will be leaving, truly.¡±
   ¡°A moment, my lord,¡± Maester Luwin said. He moved to Robb and they huddled close together, whispering. Bran tried to hear what they were saying, but their voices were too low.
   Robb Stark finally sheathed his sword. ¡°I?.?.?.?I may have been hasty with you,¡± he said. ¡°You¡¯ve done Bran a kindness, and, well?.?.?.?¡± Robb composed himself with an effort. ¡°The hospitality of Winterfell is yours if you wish it, Lannister.¡±
   ¡°Spare me your false courtesies, boy. You do not love me and you do not want me here. I saw an inn outside your walls, in the winter town. I¡¯ll find a bed there, and both of us will sleep easier. For a few coppers I may even find a comely wench to warm the sheets for me.¡± He spoke to one of the black brothers, an old man with a twisted back and a tangled beard. ¡°Yoren, we go south at daybreak. You will find me on the road, no doubt.¡± With that he made his exit, struggling across the hall on his short legs, past Rickon and out the door. His men followed.
   The four of the Night¡¯s Watch remained. Robb turned to them uncertainly. ¡°I have had rooms prepared, and you¡¯ll find no lack of hot water to wash off the dust of the road. I hope you will honor us at table tonight.¡± He spoke the words so awkwardly that even Bran took note; it was a speech he had learned, not words from the heart, but the black brothers thanked him all the same.
   Summer followed them up the tower steps as Hodor carried Bran back to his bed. Old Nan was asleep in her chair. Hodor said ¡°Hodor,¡± gathered up his great-grandmother, and carried her off, snoring softly, while Bran lay thinking. Robb had promised that he could feast with the Night¡¯s Watch in the Great Hall. ¡°Summer,¡± he called. The wolf bounded up on the bed. Bran hugged him so hard he could feel the hot breath on his cheek. ¡°I can ride now,¡± he whispered to his friend. ¡°We can go hunting in the woods soon, wait and see.¡± After a time he slept.
   In his dream he was climbing again, pulling himself up an ancient windowless tower, his fingers forcing themselves between blackened stones, his feet scrabbling for purchase. Higher and higher he climbed, through the clouds and into the night sky, and still the tower rose before him. When he paused to look down, his head swam dizzily and he felt his fingers slipping. Bran cried out and clung for dear life. The earth was a thousand miles beneath him and he could not fly. He could not fly. He waited until his heart had stopped pounding, until he could breathe, and he began to climb again. There was no way to go but up. Far above him, outlined against a vast pale moon, he thought he could see the shapes of gargoyles. His arms were sore and aching, but he dared not rest. He forced himself to climb faster. The gargoyles watched him ascend. Their eyes glowed red as hot coals in a brazier. Perhaps once they had been lions, but now they were twisted and grotesque. Bran could hear them whispering to each other in soft stone voices terrible to hear. He must not listen, he told himself, he must not hear, so long as he did not hear them he was safe. But when the gargoyles pulled themselves loose from the stone and padded down the side of the tower to where Bran clung, he knew he was not safe after all. ¡°I didn¡¯t hear,¡± he wept as they came closer and closer, ¡°I didn¡¯t, I didn¡¯t.¡±
   He woke gasping, lost in darkness, and saw a vast shadow looming over him. ¡°I didn¡¯t hear,¡± he whispered, trembling in fear, but then the shadow said ¡°Hodor,¡± and lit the candle by the bedside, and Bran sighed with relief.
   Hodor washed the sweat from him with a warm, damp cloth and dressed him with deft and gentle hands. When it was time, he carried him down to the Great Hall, where a long trestle table had been set up near the fire. The lord¡¯s seat at the head of the table had been left empty, but Robb sat to the right of it, with Bran across from him. They ate suckling pig that night, and pigeon pie, and turnips soaking in butter, and afterward the cook had promised honeycombs. Summer snatched table scraps from Bran¡¯s hand, while Grey Wind and Shaggydog fought over a bone in the corner. Winterfell¡¯s dogs would not come near the hall now. Bran had found that strange at first, but he was growing used to it.
   Yoren was senior among the black brothers, so the steward had seated him between Robb and Maester Luwin. The old man had a sour smell, as if he had not washed in a long time. He ripped at the meat with his teeth, cracked the ribs to suck out the marrow from the bones, and shrugged at the mention of Jon Snow. ¡°Ser Alliser¡¯s bane,¡± he grunted, and two of his companions shared a laugh that Bran did not understand. But when Robb asked for news of their uncle Benjen, the black brothers grew ominously quiet.
   ¡°What is it?¡± Bran asked.
   Yoren wiped his fingers on his vest. ¡°There¡¯s hard news, m¡¯lords, and a cruel way to pay you for your meat and mead, but the man as asks the question must bear the answer. Stark¡¯s gone.¡±
   One of the other men said, ¡°The Old Bear sent him out to look for Waymar Royce, and he¡¯s late returning, my lord.¡±
   ¡°Too long,¡± Yoren said. ¡°Most like he¡¯s dead.¡±
   ¡°My uncle is not dead,¡± Robb Stark said loudly, anger in his tones. He rose from the bench and laid his hand on the hilt of his sword. ¡°Do you hear me? My uncle is not dead!¡± His voice rang against the stone walls, and Bran was suddenly afraid.
   Old sour-smelling Yoren looked up at Robb, unimpressed. ¡°Whatever you say, m¡¯lord,¡± he said. He sucked at a piece of meat between his teeth.
   The youngest of the black brothers shifted uncomfortably in his seat. ¡°There¡¯s not a man on the Wall knows the haunted forest better than Benjen Stark. He¡¯ll find his way back.¡±
   ¡°Well,¡± said Yoren, ¡°maybe he will and maybe he won¡¯t. Good men have gone into those woods before, and never come out.¡±
   All Bran could think of was Old Nan¡¯s story of the Others and the last hero, hounded through the white woods by dead men and spiders big as hounds. He was afraid for a moment, until he remembered how that story ended. ¡°The children will help him,¡± he blurted, ¡°the children of the forest!¡±
   Theon Greyjoy sniggered, and Maester Luwin said, ¡°Bran, the children of the forest have been dead and gone for thousands of years. All that is left of them are the faces in the trees.¡±
   ¡°Down here, might be that¡¯s true, Maester,¡± Yoren said, ¡°but up past the Wall, who¡¯s to say? Up there, a man can¡¯t always tell what¡¯s alive and what¡¯s dead.¡±
   That night, after the plates had been cleared, Robb carried Bran up to bed himself. Grey Wind led the way, and Summer came close behind. His brother was strong for his age, and Bran was as light as a bundle of rags, but the stairs were steep and dark, and Robb was breathing hard by the time they reached the top.
   He put Bran into bed, covered him with blankets, and blew out the candle. For a time Robb sat beside him in the dark. Bran wanted to talk to him, but he did not know what to say. ¡°We¡¯ll find a horse for you, I promise,¡± Robb whispered at last.
   ¡°Are they ever coming back?¡± Bran asked him.
   ¡°Yes,¡± Robb said with such hope in his voice that Bran knew he was hearing his brother and not just Robb the Lord. ¡°Mother will be home soon. Maybe we can ride out to meet her when she comes. Wouldn¡¯t that surprise her, to see you ahorse?¡± Even in the dark room, Bran could feel his brother¡¯s smile. ¡°And afterward, we¡¯ll ride north to see the Wall. We won¡¯t even tell Jon we¡¯re coming, we¡¯ll just be there one day, you and me. It will be an adventure.¡±
   ¡°An adventure,¡± Bran repeated wistfully. He heard his brother sob. The room was so dark he could not see the tears on Robb¡¯s face, so he reached out and found his hand. Their fingers twined together.
   
   25£®EDDARD
   Lord Arryn¡¯s death was a great sadness for all of us, my lord,¡± Grand Maester Pycelle said. ¡°I would be more than happy to tell you what I can of the manner of his passing. Do be seated. Would you care for refreshments? Some dates, perhaps? I have some very fine persimmons as well. Wine no longer agrees with my digestion, I fear, but I can offer you a cup of iced milk, sweetened with honey. I find it most refreshing in this heat.¡±
   There was no denying the heat; Ned could feel the silk tunic clinging to his chest. Thick, moist air covered the city like a damp woolen blanket, and the riverside had grown unruly as the poor fled their hot, airless warrens to jostle for sleeping places near the water, where the only breath of wind was to be found. ¡°That would be most kind,¡± Ned said, seating himself.
   Pycelle lifted a tiny silver bell with thumb and forefinger and tinkled it gently. A slender young serving girl hurried into the solar. ¡°Iced milk for the King¡¯s Hand and myself, if you would be so kind, child. Well sweetened.¡±
   As the girl went to fetch their drinks, the Grand Maester knotted his fingers together and rested his hands on his stomach. ¡°The smallfolk say that the last year of summer is always the hottest. It is not so, yet ofttimes it feels that way, does it not? On days like this, I envy you northerners your summer snows.¡± The heavy jeweled chain around the old man¡¯s neck chinked softly as he shifted in his seat. ¡°To be sure, King Maekar¡¯s summer was hotter than this one, and near as long. There were fools, even in the Citadel, who took that to mean that the Great Summer had come at last, the summer that never ends, but in the seventh year it broke suddenly, and we had a short autumn and a terrible long winter. Still, the heat was fierce while it lasted. Oldtown steamed and sweltered by day and came alive only by night. We would walk in the gardens by the river and argue about the gods. I remember the smells of those nights, my lord, perfume and sweat, melons ripe to bursting, peaches and pomegranates, nightshade and moonbloom. I was a young man then, still forging my chain. The heat did not exhaust me as it does now.¡± Pycelle¡¯s eyes were so heavily lidded he looked half-asleep. ¡°My pardons, Lord Eddard. You did not come to hear foolish meanderings of a summer forgotten before your father was born. Forgive an old man his wanderings, if you would. Minds are like swords, I do fear. The old ones go to rust. Ah, and here is our milk.¡± The serving girl placed the tray between them, and Pycelle gave her a smile. ¡°Sweet child.¡± He lifted a cup, tasted, nodded. ¡°Thank you. You may go.¡±
   When the girl had taken her leave, Pycelle peered at Ned through pale, rheumy eyes. ¡°Now where were we? Oh, yes. You asked about Lord Arryn?.?.?.?¡±
   ¡°I did.¡± Ned sipped politely at the iced milk. It was pleasantly cold, but oversweet to his taste.
   ¡°If truth be told, the Hand had not seemed quite himself for some time,¡± Pycelle said. ¡°We had sat together on council many a year, he and I, and the signs were there to read, but I put them down to the great burdens he had borne so faithfully for so long. Those broad shoulders were weighed down by all the cares of the realm, and more besides. His son was ever sickly, and his lady wife so anxious that she would scarcely let the boy out of her sight. It was enough to weary even a strong man, and the Lord Jon was not young. Small wonder if he seemed melancholy and tired. Or so I thought at the time. Yet now I am less certain.¡± He gave a ponderous shake of his head.
   ¡°What can you tell me of his final illness?¡±
   The Grand Maester spread his hands in a gesture of helpless sorrow. ¡°He came to me one day asking after a certain book, as hale and healthy as ever, though it did seem to me that something was troubling him deeply. The next morning he was twisted over in pain, too sick to rise from bed. Maester Colemon thought it was a chill on the stomach. The weather had been hot, and the Hand often iced his wine, which can upset the digestion. When Lord Jon continued to weaken, I went to him myself, but the gods did not grant me the power to save him.¡±
   ¡°I have heard that you sent Maester Colemon away.¡±
   The Grand Maester¡¯s nod was as slow and deliberate as a glacier. ¡°I did, and I fear the Lady Lysa will never forgive me that. Maybe I was wrong, but at the time I thought it best. Maester Colemon is like a son to me, and I yield to none in my esteem for his abilities, but he is young, and the young ofttimes do not comprehend the frailty of an older body. He was purging Lord Arryn with wasting potions and pepper juice, and I feared he might kill him.¡±
   ¡°Did Lord Arryn say anything to you during his final hours?¡±
   Pycelle wrinkled his brow. ¡°In the last stage of his fever, the Hand called out the name Robert several times, but whether he was asking for his son or for the king I could not say. Lady Lysa would not permit the boy to enter the sickroom, for fear that he too might be taken ill. The king did come, and he sat beside the bed for hours, talking and joking of times long past in hopes of raising Lord Jon¡¯s spirits. His love was fierce to see.¡±
   ¡°Was there nothing else? No final words?¡±
   ¡°When I saw that all hope had fled, I gave the Hand the milk of the poppy, so he should not suffer. Just before he closed his eyes for the last time, he whispered something to the king and his lady wife, a blessing for his son. The seed is strong, he said. At the end, his speech was too slurred to comprehend. Death did not come until the next morning, but Lord Jon was at peace after that. He never spoke again.¡±
   Ned took another swallow of milk, trying not to gag on the sweetness of it. ¡°Did it seem to you that there was anything unnatural about Lord Arryn¡¯s death?¡±
   ¡°Unnatural?¡± The aged maester¡¯s voice was thin as a whisper. ¡°No, I could not say so. Sad, for a certainty. Yet in its own way, death is the most natural thing of all, Lord Eddard. Jon Arryn rests easy now, his burdens lifted at last.¡±
   ¡°This illness that took him,¡± said Ned. ¡°Had you ever seen its like before, in other men?¡±
   ¡°Near forty years I have been Grand Maester of the Seven Kingdoms,¡± Pycelle replied. ¡°Under our good King Robert, and Aerys Targaryen before him, and his father Jaehaerys the Second before him, and even for a few short months under Jaehaerys¡¯s father, Aegon the Fortunate, the Fifth of His Name. I have seen more of illness than I care to remember, my lord. I will tell you this: Every case is different, and every case is alike. Lord Jon¡¯s death was no stranger than any other.¡±
   ¡°His wife thought otherwise.¡±
   The Grand Maester nodded. ¡°I recall now, the widow is sister to your own noble wife. If an old man may be forgiven his blunt speech, let me say that grief can derange even the strongest and most disciplined of minds, and the Lady Lysa was never that. Since her last stillbirth, she has seen enemies in every shadow, and the death of her lord husband left her shattered and lost.¡±
   ¡°So you are quite certain that Jon Arryn died of a sudden illness?¡±
   ¡°I am,¡± Pycelle replied gravely. ¡°If not illness, my good lord, what else could it be?¡±
   ¡°Poison,¡± Ned suggested quietly.
   Pycelle¡¯s sleepy eyes flicked open. The aged maester shifted uncomfortably in his seat. ¡°A disturbing thought. We are not the Free Cities, where such things are common. Grand Maester Aethelmure wrote that all men carry murder in their hearts, yet even so, the poisoner is beneath contempt.¡± He fell silent for a moment, his eyes lost in thought. ¡°What you suggest is possible, my lord, yet I do not think it likely. Every hedge maester knows the common poisons, and Lord Arryn displayed none of the signs. And the Hand was loved by all. What sort of monster in man¡¯s flesh would dare to murder such a noble lord?¡±
   ¡°I have heard it said that poison is a woman¡¯s weapon.¡±
   Pycelle stroked his beard thoughtfully. ¡°It is said. Women, cravens?.?.?.?and eunuchs.¡± He cleared his throat and spat a thick glob of phelm onto the rushes. Above them, a raven cawed loudly in the rookery. ¡°The Lord Varys was born a slave in Lys, did you know? Put not your trust in spiders, my lord.¡±
   That was scarcely anything Ned needed to be told; there was something about Varys that made his flesh crawl. ¡°I will remember that, Maester. And I thank you for your help. I have taken enough of your time.¡± He stood.
   Grand Maester Pycelle pushed himself up from his chair slowly and escorted Ned to the door. ¡°I hope I have helped in some small way to put your mind at ease. If there is any other service I might perform, you need only ask.¡±
   ¡°One thing,¡± Ned told him. ¡°I should be curious to examine the book that you lent Jon the day before he fell ill.¡±
   ¡°I fear you would find it of little interest,¡± Pycelle said. ¡°It was a ponderous tome by Grand Maester Malleon on the lineages of the great houses.¡±
   ¡°Still, I should like to see it.¡±
   The old man opened the door. ¡°As you wish. I have it here somewhere. When I find it, I shall have it sent to your chambers straightaway.¡±
   ¡°You have been most courteous,¡± Ned told him. Then, almost as an afterthought, he said, ¡°One last question, if you would be so kind. You mentioned that the king was at Lord Arryn¡¯s bedside when he died. I wonder, was the queen with him?¡±
   ¡°Why, no,¡± Pycelle said. ¡°She and the children were making the journey to Casterly Rock, in company with her father. Lord Tywin had brought a retinue to the city for the tourney on Prince Joffrey¡¯s name day, no doubt hoping to see his son Jaime win the champion¡¯s crown. In that he was sadly disappointed. It fell to me to send the queen word of Lord Arryn¡¯s sudden death. Never have I sent off a bird with a heavier heart.¡±
   ¡°Dark wings, dark words,¡± Ned murmured. It was a proverb Old Nan had taught him as a boy.
   ¡°So the fishwives say,¡± Grand Maester Pycelle agreed, ¡°but we know it is not always so. When Maester Luwin¡¯s bird brought the word about your Bran, the message lifted every true heart in the castle, did it not?¡±
   ¡°As you say, Maester.¡±
   ¡°The gods are merciful.¡± Pycelle bowed his head. ¡°Come to me as often as you like, Lord Eddard. I am here to serve.¡±
   Yes, Ned thought as the door swung shut, but whom?
   On the way back to his chambers, he came upon his daughter Arya on the winding steps of the Tower of the Hand, windmilling her arms as she struggled to balance on one leg. The rough stone had scuffed her bare feet. Ned stopped and looked at her. ¡°Arya, what are you doing?¡±
   ¡°Syrio says a water dancer can stand on one toe for hours.¡± Her hands flailed at the air to steady herself.
   Ned had to smile. ¡°Which toe?¡± he teased.
   ¡°Any toe,¡± Arya said, exasperated with the question. She hopped from her right leg to her left, swaying dangerously before she regained her balance.
   ¡°Must you do your standing here?¡± he asked. ¡°It¡¯s a long hard fall down these steps.¡±
   ¡°Syrio says a water dancer never falls.¡± She lowered her leg to stand on two feet. ¡°Father, will Bran come and live with us now?¡±
   ¡°Not for a long time, sweet one,¡± he told her. ¡°He needs to win his strength back.¡±
   Arya bit her lip. ¡°What will Bran do when he¡¯s of age?¡±
   Ned knelt beside her. ¡°He has years to find that answer, Arya. For now, it is enough to know that he will live.¡± The night the bird had come from Winterfell, Eddard Stark had taken the girls to the castle godswood, an acre of elm and alder and black cottonwood overlooking the river. The heart tree there was a great oak, its ancient limbs overgrown with smokeberry vines; they knelt before it to offer their thanksgiving, as if it had been a weirwood. Sansa drifted to sleep as the moon rose, Arya several hours later, curling up in the grass under Ned¡¯s cloak. All through the dark hours he kept his vigil alone. When dawn broke over the city, the dark red blooms of dragon¡¯s breath surrounded the girls where they lay. ¡°I dreamed of Bran,¡± Sansa had whispered to him. ¡°I saw him smiling.¡±
   ¡°He was going to be a knight,¡± Arya was saying now. ¡°A knight of the Kingsguard. Can he still be a knight?¡±
   ¡°No,¡± Ned said. He saw no use in lying to her. ¡°Yet someday he may be the lord of a great holdfast and sit on the king¡¯s council. He might raise castles like Brandon the Builder, or sail a ship across the Sunset Sea, or enter your mother¡¯s Faith and become the High Septon.¡± But he will never run beside his wolf again, he thought with a sadness too deep for words, or lie with a woman, or hold his own son in his arms.
   Arya cocked her head to one side. ¡°Can I be a king¡¯s councillor and build castles and become the High Septon?¡±
   ¡°You,¡± Ned said, kissing her lightly on the brow, ¡°will marry a king and rule his castle, and your sons will be knights and princes and lords and, yes, perhaps even a High Septon.¡±
   Arya screwed up her face. ¡°No,¡± she said, ¡°that¡¯s Sansa.¡± She folded up her right leg and resumed her balancing. Ned sighed and left her there.
   Inside his chambers, he stripped off his sweat-stained silks and sluiced cold water over his head from the basin beside the bed. Alyn entered as he was drying his face. ¡°My lord,¡± he said, ¡°Lord Baelish is without and begs audience.¡±
   ¡°Escort him to my solar,¡± Ned said, reaching for a fresh tunic, the lightest linen he could find. ¡°I¡¯ll see him at once.¡±
   Littlefinger was perched on the window seat when Ned entered, watching the knights of the Kingsguard practice at swords in the yard below. ¡°If only old Selmy¡¯s mind were as nimble as his blade,¡± he said wistfully, ¡°our council meetings would be a good deal livelier.¡±
   ¡°Ser Barristan is as valiant and honorable as any man in King¡¯s Landing.¡± Ned had come to have a deep respect for the aged, white-haired Lord Commander of the Kingsguard.
   ¡°And as tiresome,¡± Littlefinger added, ¡°though I daresay he should do well in the tourney. Last year he unhorsed the Hound, and it was only four years ago that he was champion.¡±
   The question of who might win the tourney interested Eddard Stark not in the least. ¡°Is there a reason for this visit, Lord Petyr, or are you here simply to enjoy the view from my window?¡±
   Littlefinger smiled. ¡°I promised Cat I would help you in your inquiries, and so I have.¡±
   That took Ned aback. Promise or no promise, he could not find it in him to trust Lord Petyr Baelish, who struck him as too clever by half. ¡°You have something for me?¡±
   ¡°Someone,¡± Littlefinger corrected. ¡°Four someones, if truth be told. Had you thought to question the Hand¡¯s servants?¡±
   Ned frowned. ¡°Would that I could. Lady Arryn took her household back to the Eyrie.¡± Lysa had done him no favor in that regard. All those who had stood closest to her husband had gone with her when she fled: Jon¡¯s maester, his steward, the captain of his guard, his knights and retainers.
   ¡°Most of her household,¡± Littlefinger said, ¡°not all. A few remain. A pregnant kitchen girl hastily wed to one of Lord Renly¡¯s grooms, a stablehand who joined the City Watch, a potboy discharged from service for theft, and Lord Arryn¡¯s squire.¡±
   ¡°His squire?¡± Ned was pleasantly surprised. A man¡¯s squire often knew a great deal of his comings and goings.
   ¡°Ser Hugh of the Vale,¡± Littlefinger named him. ¡°The king knighted the boy after Lord Arryn¡¯s death.¡±
   ¡°I shall send for him,¡± Ned said. ¡°And the others.¡±
   Littlefinger winced. ¡°My lord, step over here to the window, if you would be so kind.¡±
   ¡°Why?¡±
   ¡°Come, and I¡¯ll show you, my lord.¡±
   Frowning, Ned crossed to the window. Petyr Baelish made a casual gesture. ¡°There, across the yard, at the door of the armory, do you see the boy squatting by the steps honing a sword with an oilstone?¡±
   ¡°What of him?¡±
   ¡°He reports to Varys. The Spider has taken a great interest in you and all your doings.¡± He shifted in the window seat. ¡°Now glance at the wall. Farther west, above the stables. The guardsman leaning on the ramparts?¡±
   Ned saw the man. ¡°Another of the eunuch¡¯s whisperers?¡±
   ¡°No, this one belongs to the queen. Notice that he enjoys a fine view of the door to this tower, the better to note who calls on you. There are others, many unknown even to me. The Red Keep is full of eyes. Why do you think I hid Cat in a brothel?¡±
   Eddard Stark had no taste for these intrigues. ¡°Seven hells,¡± he swore. It did seem as though the man on the walls was watching him. Suddenly uncomfortable, Ned moved away from the window. ¡°Is everyone someone¡¯s informer in this cursed city?¡±
   ¡°Scarcely,¡± said Littlefinger. He counted on the fingers on his hand. ¡°Why, there¡¯s me, you, the king?.?.?.?although, come to think on it, the king tells the queen much too much, and I¡¯m less than certain about you.¡± He stood up. ¡°Is there a man in your service that you trust utterly and completely?¡±
   ¡°Yes,¡± said Ned.
   ¡°In that case, I have a delightful palace in Valyria that I would dearly love to sell you,¡± Littlefinger said with a mocking smile. ¡°The wiser answer was no, my lord, but be that as it may. Send this paragon of yours to Ser Hugh and the others. Your own comings and goings will be noted, but even Varys the Spider cannot watch every man in your service every hour of the day.¡± He started for the door.
   ¡°Lord Petyr,¡± Ned called after him. ¡°I?.?.?.?am grateful for your help. Perhaps I was wrong to distrust you.¡±
   Littlefinger fingered his small pointed beard. ¡°You are slow to learn, Lord Eddard. Distrusting me was the wisest thing you¡¯ve done since you climbed down off your horse.¡±
   
   26£®JON
   Jon was showing Dareon how best to deliver a sidestroke when the new recruit entered the practice yard. ¡°Your feet should be farther apart,¡± he urged. ¡°You don¡¯t want to lose your balance. That¡¯s good. Now pivot as you deliver the stroke, get all your weight behind the blade.¡±
   Dareon broke off and lifted his visor. ¡°Seven gods,¡± he murmured. ¡°Would you look at this, Jon.¡±
   Jon turned. Through the eye slit of his helm, he beheld the fattest boy he had ever seen standing in the door of the armory. By the look of him, he must have weighed twenty stone. The fur collar of his embroidered surcoat was lost beneath his chins. Pale eyes moved nervously in a great round moon of a face, and plump sweaty fingers wiped themselves on the velvet of his doublet. ¡°They ?.?.?.?they told me I was to come here for?.?.?.?for training,¡± he said to no one in particular.
   ¡°A lordling,¡± Pyp observed to Jon. ¡°Southron, most like near Highgarden.¡± Pyp had traveled the Seven Kingdoms with a mummers¡¯ troupe, and bragged that he could tell what you were and where you¡¯d been born just from the sound of your voice.
   A striding huntsman had been worked in scarlet thread upon the breast of the fat boy¡¯s fur-trimmed surcoat. Jon did not recognize the sigil. Ser Alliser Thorne looked over his new charge and said, ¡°It would seem they have run short of poachers and thieves down south. Now they send us pigs to man the Wall. Is fur and velvet your notion of armor, my Lord of Ham?¡±
   It was soon revealed that the new recruit had brought his own armor with him; padded doublet, boiled leather, mail and plate and helm, even a great wood-and-leather shield blazoned with the same striding huntsman he wore on his surcoat. As none of it was black, however, Ser Alliser insisted that he reequip himself from the armory. That took half the morning. His girth required Donal Noye to take apart a mail hauberk and refit it with leather panels at the sides. To get a helm over his head the armorer had to detach the visor. His leathers bound so tightly around his legs and under his arms that he could scarcely move. Dressed for battle, the new boy looked like an overcooked sausage about to burst its skin. ¡°Let us hope you are not as inept as you look,¡± Ser Alliser said. ¡°Halder, see what Ser Piggy can do.¡±
   Jon Snow winced. Halder had been born in a quarry and apprenticed as a stonemason. He was sixteen, tall and muscular, and his blows were as hard as any Jon had ever felt. ¡°This will be uglier than a whore¡¯s ass,¡± Pyp muttered, and it was.
   The fight lasted less than a minute before the fat boy was on the ground, his whole body shaking as blood leaked through his shattered helm and between his pudgy fingers. ¡°I yield,¡± he shrilled. ¡°No more, I yield, don¡¯t hit me.¡± Rast and some of the other boys were laughing.
   Even then, Ser Alliser would not call an end. ¡°On your feet, Ser Piggy,¡± he called. ¡°Pick up your sword.¡± When the boy continued to cling to the ground, Thorne gestured to Halder. ¡°Hit him with the flat of your blade until he finds his feet.¡± Halder delivered a tentative smack to his foe¡¯s upraised cheeks. ¡°You can hit harder than that,¡± Thorne taunted. Halder took hold of his longsword with both hands and brought it down so hard the blow split leather, even on the flat. The new boy screeched in pain.
   Jon Snow took a step forward. Pyp laid a mailed hand on his arm. ¡°Jon, no,¡± the small boy whispered with an anxious glance at Ser Alliser Thorne.
   ¡°On your feet,¡± Thorne repeated. The fat boy struggled to rise, slipped, and fell heavily again. ¡°Ser Piggy is starting to grasp the notion,¡± Ser Alliser observed. ¡°Again.¡±
   Halder lifted the sword for another blow. ¡°Cut us off a ham!¡± Rast urged, laughing.
   Jon shook off Pyp¡¯s hand. ¡°Halder, enough.¡±
   Halder looked to Ser Alliser.
   ¡°The Bastard speaks and the peasants tremble,¡± the master-at-arms said in that sharp, cold voice of his. ¡°I remind you that I am the master-at-arms here, Lord Snow.¡±
   ¡°Look at him, Halder,¡± Jon urged, ignoring Thorne as best he could. ¡°There¡¯s no honor in beating a fallen foe. He yielded.¡± He knelt beside the fat boy.
   Halder lowered his sword. ¡°He yielded,¡± he echoed.
   Ser Alliser¡¯s onyx eyes were fixed on Jon Snow. ¡°It would seem our Bastard is in love,¡± he said as Jon helped the fat boy to his feet. ¡°Show me your steel, Lord Snow.¡±
   Jon drew his longsword. He dared defy Ser Alliser only to a point, and he feared he was well beyond it now.
   Thorne smiled. ¡°The Bastard wishes to defend his lady love, so we shall make an exercise of it. Rat, Pimple, help our Stone Head here.¡± Rast and Albett moved to join Halder. ¡°Three of you ought to be sufficient to make Lady Piggy squeal. All you need do is get past the Bastard.¡±
   ¡°Stay behind me,¡± Jon said to the fat boy. Ser Alliser had often sent two foes against him, but never three. He knew he would likely go to sleep bruised and bloody tonight. He braced himself for the assault.
   Suddenly Pyp was beside him. ¡°Three to two will make for better sport,¡± the small boy said cheerfully. He dropped his visor and slid out his sword. Before Jon could even think to protest, Grenn had stepped up to make a third.
   The yard had grown deathly quiet. Jon could feel Ser Alliser¡¯s eyes. ¡°Why are you waiting?¡± he asked Rast and the others in a voice gone deceptively soft, but it was Jon who moved first. Halder barely got his sword up in time.
   Jon drove him backward, attacking with every blow, keeping the older boy on the heels. Know your foe, Ser Rodrik had taught him once; Jon knew Halder, brutally strong but short of patience, with no taste for defense. Frustrate him, and he would leave himself open, as certain as sunset.
   The clang of steel echoed through the yard as the others joined battle around him. Jon blocked a savage cut at his head, the shock of impact running up his arm as the swords crashed together. He slammed a sidestroke into Halder¡¯s ribs, and was rewarded with a muffled grunt of pain. The counterstroke caught Jon on the shoulder. Chainmail crunched, and pain flared up his neck, but for an instant Halder was unbalanced. Jon cut his left leg from under him, and he fell with a curse and a crash.
   Grenn was standing his ground as Jon had taught him, giving Albett more than he cared for, but Pyp was hard-pressed. Rast had two years and forty pounds on him. Jon stepped up behind him and rang the raper¡¯s helm like a bell. As Rast went reeling, Pyp slid in under his guard, knocked him down, and leveled a blade at his throat. By then Jon had moved on. Facing two swords, Albett backed away. ¡°I yield,¡± he shouted.
   Ser Alliser Thorne surveyed the scene with disgust. ¡°The mummer¡¯s farce has gone on long enough for today.¡± He walked away. The session was at an end.
   Dareon helped Halder to his feet. The quarryman¡¯s son wrenched off his helm and threw it across the yard. ¡°For an instant, I thought I finally had you, Snow.¡±
   ¡°For an instant, you did,¡± Jon replied. Under his mail and leather, his shoulder was throbbing. He sheathed his sword and tried to remove his helm, but when he raised his arm, the pain made him grit his teeth.
   ¡°Let me,¡± a voice said. Thick-fingered hands unfastened helm from gorget and lifted it off gently. ¡°Did he hurt you?¡±
   ¡°I¡¯ve been bruised before.¡± He touched his shoulder and winced. The yard was emptying around them.
   Blood matted the fat boy¡¯s hair where Halder had split his helm asunder. ¡°My name is Samwell Tarly, of Horn?.?.?.?¡± He stopped and licked his lips. ¡°I mean, I was of Horn Hill, until I?.?.?.?left. I¡¯ve come to take the black. My father is Lord Randyll, a bannerman to the Tyrells of Highgarden. I used to be his heir, only?.?.?.?¡± His voice trailed off.
   ¡°I¡¯m Jon Snow, Ned Stark¡¯s bastard, of Winterfell.¡±
   Samwell Tarly nodded. ¡°I?.?.?.?if you want, you can call me Sam. My mother calls me Sam.¡±
   ¡°You can call him Lord Snow,¡± Pyp said as he came up to join them. ¡°You don¡¯t want to know what his mother calls him.¡±
   ¡°These two are Grenn and Pypar,¡± Jon said.
   ¡°Grenn¡¯s the ugly one,¡± Pyp said.
   Grenn scowled. ¡°You¡¯re uglier than me. At least I don¡¯t have ears like a bat.¡±
   ¡°My thanks to all of you,¡± the fat boy said gravely.
   ¡°Why didn¡¯t you get up and fight?¡± Grenn demanded.
   ¡°I wanted to, truly. I just?.?.?.?I couldn¡¯t. I didn¡¯t want him to hit me anymore.¡± He looked at the ground. ¡°I?.?.?.?I fear I¡¯m a coward. My lord father always said so.¡±
   Grenn looked thunderstruck. Even Pyp had no words to say to that, and Pyp had words for everything. What sort of man would proclaim himself a coward?
   Samwell Tarly must have read their thoughts on their faces. His eyes met Jon¡¯s and darted away, quick as frightened animals. ¡°I?.?.?.?I¡¯m sorry,¡± he said. ¡°I don¡¯t mean to?.?.?.?to be like I am.¡± He walked heavily toward the armory.
   Jon called after him. ¡°You were hurt,¡± he said. ¡°Tomorrow you¡¯ll do better.¡±
   Sam looked mournfully back over one shoulder. ¡°No I won¡¯t,¡± he said, blinking back tears. ¡°I never do better.¡±
   When he was gone, Grenn frowned. ¡°Nobody likes cravens,¡± he said uncomfortably. ¡°I wish we hadn¡¯t helped him. What if they think we¡¯re craven too?¡±
   ¡°You¡¯re too stupid to be craven,¡± Pyp told him.
   ¡°I am not,¡± Grenn said.
   ¡°Yes you are. If a bear attacked you in the woods, you¡¯d be too stupid to run away.¡±
   ¡°I would not,¡± Grenn insisted. ¡°I¡¯d run away faster than you.¡± He stopped suddenly, scowling when he saw Pyp¡¯s grin and realized what he¡¯d just said. His thick neck flushed a dark red. Jon left them there arguing as he returned to the armory, hung up his sword, and stripped off his battered armor.
   Life at Castle Black followed certain patterns; the mornings were for swordplay, the afternoons for work. The black brothers set new recruits to many different tasks, to learn where their skills lay. Jon cherished the rare afternoons when he was sent out with Ghost ranging at his side to bring back game for the Lord Commander¡¯s table, but for every day spent hunting, he gave a dozen to Donal Noye in the armory, spinning the whetstone while the one-armed smith sharpened axes grown dull from use, or pumping the bellows as Noye hammered out a new sword. Other times he ran messages, stood at guard, mucked out stables, fletched arrows, assisted Maester Aemon with his birds or Bowen Marsh with his counts and inventories.
   That afternoon, the watch commander sent him to the winch cage with four barrels of fresh-crushed stone, to scatter gravel over the icy footpaths atop the Wall. It was lonely and boring work, even with Ghost along for company, but Jon found he did not mind. On a clear day you could see half the world from the top of the Wall, and the air was always cold and bracing. He could think here, and he found himself thinking of Samwell Tarly?.?.?.?and, oddly, of Tyrion Lannister. He wondered what Tyrion would have made of the fat boy. Most men would rather deny a hard truth than face it, the dwarf had told him, grinning. The world was full of cravens who pretended to be heroes; it took a queer sort of courage to admit to cowardice as Samwell Tarly had.
   His sore shoulder made the work go slowly. It was late afternoon before Jon finished graveling the paths. He lingered on high to watch the sun go down, turning the western sky the color of blood. Finally, as dusk was settling over the north, Jon rolled the empty barrels back into the cage and signaled the winch men to lower him.
   The evening meal was almost done by the time he and Ghost reached the common hall. A group of the black brothers were dicing over mulled wine near the fire. His friends were at the bench nearest the west wall, laughing. Pyp was in the middle of a story. The mummer¡¯s boy with the big ears was a born liar with a hundred different voices, and he did not tell his tales so much as live them, playing all the parts as needed, a king one moment and a swineherd the next. When he turned into an alehouse girl or a virgin princess, he used a high falsetto voice that reduced them all to tears of helpless laughter, and his eunuchs were always eerily accurate caricatures of Ser Alliser. Jon took as much pleasure from Pyp¡¯s antics as anyone?.?.?.?yet that night he turned away and went instead to the end of the bench, where Samwell Tarly sat alone, as far from the others as he could get.
   He was finishing the last of the pork pie the cooks had served up for supper when Jon sat down across from him. The fat boy¡¯s eyes widened at the sight of Ghost. ¡°Is that a wolf?¡±
   ¡°A direwolf,¡± Jon said. ¡°His name is Ghost. The direwolf is the sigil of my father¡¯s House.¡±
   ¡°Ours is a striding huntsman,¡± Samwell Tarly said.
   ¡°Do you like to hunt?¡±
   The fat boy shuddered. ¡°I hate it.¡± He looked as though he was going to cry again.
   ¡°What¡¯s wrong now?¡± Jon asked him. ¡°Why are you always so frightened?¡±
   Sam stared at the last of his pork pie and gave a feeble shake of his head, too scared even to talk. A burst of laughter filled the hall. Jon heard Pyp squeaking in a high voice. He stood. ¡°Let¡¯s go outside.¡±
   The round fat face looked up at him, suspicious. ¡°Why? What will we do outside?¡±
   ¡°Talk,¡± Jon said. ¡°Have you seen the Wall?¡±
   ¡°I¡¯m fat, not blind,¡± Samwell Tarly said. ¡°Of course I saw it, it¡¯s seven hundred feet high.¡± Yet he stood up all the same, wrapped a fur-lined cloak over his shoulders, and followed Jon from the common hall, still wary, as if he suspected some cruel trick was waiting for him in the night. Ghost padded along beside them. ¡°I never thought it would be like this,¡± Sam said as they walked, his words steaming in the cold air. Already he was huffing and puffing as he tried to keep up. ¡°All the buildings are falling down, and it¡¯s so?.?.?.?so?.?.?.?¡±
   ¡°Cold?¡± A hard frost was settling over the castle, and Jon could hear the soft crunch of grey weeds beneath his boots.
   Sam nodded miserably. ¡°I hate the cold,¡± he said. ¡°Last night I woke up in the dark and the fire had gone out and I was certain I was going to freeze to death by morning.¡±
   ¡°It must have been warmer where you come from.¡±
   ¡°I never saw snow until last month. We were crossing the barrowlands, me and the men my father sent to see me north, and this white stuff began to fall, like a soft rain. At first I thought it was so beautiful, like feathers drifting from the sky, but it kept on and on, until I was frozen to the bone. The men had crusts of snow in their beards and more on their shoulders, and still it kept coming. I was afraid it would never end.¡±
   Jon smiled.
   The Wall loomed before them, glimmering palely in the light of the half moon. In the sky above, the stars burned clear and sharp. ¡°Are they going to make me go up there?¡± Sam asked. His face curdled like old milk as he looked at the great wooden stairs. ¡°I¡¯ll die if I have to climb that.¡±
   ¡°There¡¯s a winch,¡± Jon said, pointing. ¡°They can draw you up in a cage.¡±
   Samwell Tarly sniffled. ¡°I don¡¯t like high places.¡±
   It was too much. Jon frowned, incredulous. ¡°Are you afraid of everything?¡± he asked. ¡°I don¡¯t understand. If you are truly so craven, why are you here? Why would a coward want to join the Night¡¯s Watch?¡±
   Samwell Tarly looked at him for a long moment, and his round face seemed to cave in on itself. He sat down on the frost-covered ground and began to cry, huge choking sobs that made his whole body shake. Jon Snow could only stand and watch. Like the snowfall on the barrowlands, it seemed the tears would never end.
   It was Ghost who knew what to do. Silent as shadow, the pale direwolf moved closer and began to lick the warm tears off Samwell Tarly¡¯s face. The fat boy cried out, startled?.?.?.?and somehow, in a heartbeat, his sobs turned to laughter.
   Jon Snow laughed with him. Afterward they sat on the frozen ground, huddled in their cloaks with Ghost between them. Jon told the story of how he and Robb had found the pups newborn in the late summer snows. It seemed a thousand years ago now. Before long he found himself talking of Winterfell.
   ¡°Sometimes I dream about it,¡± he said. ¡°I¡¯m walking down this long empty hall. My voice echoes all around, but no one answers, so I walk faster, opening doors, shouting names. I don¡¯t even know who I¡¯m looking for. Most nights it¡¯s my father, but sometimes it¡¯s Robb instead, or my little sister Arya, or my uncle.¡± The thought of Benjen Stark saddened him; his uncle was still missing. The Old Bear had sent out rangers in search of him. Ser Jaremy Rykker had led two sweeps, and Quorin Halfhand had gone forth from the Shadow Tower, but they¡¯d found nothing aside from a few blazes in the trees that his uncle had left to mark his way. In the stony highlands to the northwest, the marks stopped abruptly and all trace of Ben Stark vanished.
   ¡°Do you ever find anyone in your dream?¡± Sam asked.
   Jon shook his head. ¡°No one. The castle is always empty.¡± He had never told anyone of the dream, and he did not understand why he was telling Sam now, yet somehow it felt good to talk of it. ¡°Even the ravens are gone from the rookery, and the stables are full of bones. That always scares me. I start to run then, throwing open doors, climbing the tower three steps at a time, screaming for someone, for anyone. And then I find myself in front of the door to the crypts. It¡¯s black inside, and I can see the steps spiraling down. Somehow I know I have to go down there, but I don¡¯t want to. I¡¯m afraid of what might be waiting for me. The old Kings of Winter are down there, sitting on their thrones with stone wolves at their feet and iron swords across their laps, but it¡¯s not them I¡¯m afraid of. I scream that I¡¯m not a Stark, that this isn¡¯t my place, but it¡¯s no good, I have to go anyway, so I start down, feeling the walls as I descend, with no torch to light the way. It gets darker and darker, until I want to scream.¡± He stopped, frowning, embarrassed. ¡°That¡¯s when I always wake.¡± His skin cold and clammy, shivering in the darkness of his cell. Ghost would leap up beside him, his warmth as comforting as daybreak. He would go back to sleep with his face pressed into the direwolf s shaggy white fur. ¡°Do you dream of Horn Hill?¡± Jon asked.
   ¡°No.¡± Sam¡¯s mouth grew tight and hard. ¡°I hated it there.¡± He scratched Ghost behind the ear, brooding, and Jon let the silence breathe. After a long while Samwell Tarly began to talk, and Jon Snow listened quietly, and learned how it was that a self-confessed coward found himself on the Wall.
   The Tarlys were a family old in honor, bannermen to Mace Tyrell, Lord of Highgarden and Warden of the South. The eldest son of Lord Randyll Tarly, Samwell was born heir to rich lands, a strong keep, and a storied two-handed greatsword named Heartsbane, forged of Valyrian steel and passed down from father to son near five hundred years.
   Whatever pride his lord father might have felt at Samwell¡¯s birth vanished as the boy grew up plump, soft, and awkward. Sam loved to listen to music and make his own songs, to wear soft velvets, to play in the castle kitchen beside the cooks, drinking in the rich smells as he snitched lemon cakes and blueberry tarts. His passions were books and kittens and dancing, clumsy as he was. But he grew ill at the sight of blood, and wept to see even a chicken slaughtered. A dozen masters-at-arms came and went at Horn Hill, trying to turn Samwell into the knight his father wanted. The boy was cursed and caned, slapped and starved. One man had him sleep in his chainmail to make him more martial. Another dressed him in his mother¡¯s clothing and paraded him through the bailey to shame him into valor. He only grew fatter and more frightened, until Lord Randyll¡¯s disappointment turned to anger and then to loathing. ¡°One time,¡± Sam confided, his voice dropping from a whisper, ¡°two men came to the castle, warlocks from Qarth with white skin and blue lips. They slaughtered a bull aurochs and made me bathe in the hot blood, but it didn¡¯t make me brave as they¡¯d promised. I got sick and retched. Father had them scourged.¡±
   Finally, after three girls in as many years, Lady Tarly gave her lord husband a second son. From that day, Lord Randyll ignored Sam, devoting all his time to the younger boy, a fierce, robust child more to his liking. Samwell had known several years of sweet peace with his music and his books.
   Until the dawn of his fifteenth name day, when he had been awakened to find his horse saddled and ready. Three men-at-arms had escorted him into a wood near Horn Hill, where his father was skinning a deer. ¡°You are almost a man grown now, and my heir,¡± Lord Randyll Tarly had told his eldest son, his long knife laying bare the carcass as he spoke. ¡°You have given me no cause to disown you, but neither will I allow you to inherit the land and title that should be Dickon¡¯s. Heartsbane must go to a man strong enough to wield her, and you are not worthy to touch her hilt. So I have decided that you shall this day announce that you wish to take the black. You will forsake all claim to your brother¡¯s inheritance and start north before evenfall.
   ¡°If you do not, then on the morrow we shall have a hunt, and somewhere in these woods your horse will stumble, and you will be thrown from the saddle to die?.?.?.?or so I will tell your mother. She has a woman¡¯s heart and finds it in her to cherish even you, and I have no wish to cause her pain. Please do not imagine that it will truly be that easy, should you think to defy me. Nothing would please me more than to hunt you down like the pig you are.¡± His arms were red to the elbow as he laid the skinning knife aside. ¡°So. There is your choice. The Night¡¯s Watch,¡± he reached inside the deer, ripped out its heart, and held it in his fist, red and dripping, ¡°or this.¡±
   Sam told the tale in a calm, dead voice, as if it were something that had happened to someone else, not to him. And strangely, Jon thought, he did not weep, not even once. When he was done, they sat together and listened to the wind for a time. There was no other sound in all the world.
   Finally Jon said, ¡°We should go back to the common hall.¡±
   ¡°Why?¡± Sam asked.
   Jon shrugged. ¡°There¡¯s hot cider to drink, or mulled wine if you prefer. Some nights Dareon sings for us, if the mood is on him. He was a singer, before?.?.?.?well, not truly, but almost, an apprentice singer.¡±
   ¡°How did he come here?¡± Sam asked.
   ¡°Lord Rowan of Goldengrove found him in bed with his daughter. The girl was two years older, and Dareon swears she helped him through her window, but under her father¡¯s eye she named it rape, so here he is. When Maester Aemon heard him sing, he said his voice was honey poured over thunder.¡± Jon smiled. ¡°Toad sometimes sings too, if you call it singing. Drinking songs he learned in his father¡¯s winesink. Pyp says his voice is piss poured over a fart.¡± They laughed at that together.
   ¡°I should like to hear them both,¡± Sam admitted, ¡°but they would not want me there.¡± His face was troubled. ¡°He¡¯s going to make me fight again on the morrow, isn¡¯t he?¡±
   ¡°He is,¡± Jon was forced to say.
   Sam got awkwardly to his feet. ¡°I had better try to sleep.¡± He huddled down in his cloak and plodded off.
   The others were still in the common room when Jon returned, alone but for Ghost. ¡°Where have you been?¡± Pyp asked.
   ¡°Talking with Sam,¡± he said.
   ¡°He truly is craven,¡± said Grenn. ¡°At supper, there were still places on the bench when he got his pie, but he was too scared to come sit with us.¡±
   ¡°The Lord of Ham thinks he¡¯s too good to eat with the likes of us,¡± suggested Jeren.
   ¡°I saw him eat a pork pie,¡± Toad said, smirking. ¡°Do you think it was a brother?¡± He began to make oinking noises.
   ¡°Stop it!¡± Jon snapped angrily.
   The other boys fell silent, taken aback by his sudden fury. ¡°Listen to me,¡± Jon said into the quiet, and he told them how it was going to be. Pyp backed him, as he¡¯d known he would, but when Halder spoke up, it was a pleasant surprise. Grenn was anxious at the first, but Jon knew the words to move him. One by one the rest fell in line. Jon persuaded some, cajoled some, shamed the others, made threats where threats were required. At the end they had all agreed?.?.?.?all but Rast.
   ¡°You girls do as you please,¡± Rast said, ¡°but if Thorne sends me against Lady Piggy, I¡¯m going to slice me off a rasher of bacon.¡± He laughed in Jon¡¯s face and left them there.
   Hours later, as the castle slept, three of them paid a call on his cell. Grenn held his arms while Pyp sat on his legs. Jon could hear Rast¡¯s rapid breathing as Ghost leapt onto his chest. The direwolf¡¯s eyes burned red as embers as his teeth nipped lightly at the soft skin of the boy¡¯s throat, just enough to draw blood. ¡°Remember, we know where you sleep,¡± Jon said softly.
   The next morning Jon heard Rast tell Albett and Toad how his razor had slipped while he shaved.
   From that day forth, neither Rast nor any of the others would hurt Samwell Tarly. When Ser Alliser matched them against him, they would stand their ground and swat aside his slow, clumsy strokes. If the master-at-arms screamed for an attack, they would dance in and tap Sam lightly on breastplate or helm or leg. Ser Alliser raged and threatened and called them all cravens and women and worse, yet Sam remained unhurt. A few nights later, at Jon¡¯s urging, he joined them for the evening meal, taking a place on the bench beside Halder. It was another fortnight before he found the nerve to join their talk, but in time he was laughing at Pyp¡¯s faces and teasing Grenn with the best of them.
   Fat and awkward and frightened he might be, but Samwell Tarly was no fool. One night he visited Jon in his cell. ¡°I don¡¯t know what you did,¡± he said, ¡°but I know you did it.¡± He looked away shyly. ¡°I¡¯ve never had a friend before.¡±
   ¡°We¡¯re not friends,¡± Jon said. He put a hand on Sam¡¯s broad shoulder. ¡°We¡¯re brothers.¡±
   And so they were, he thought to himself after Sam had taken his leave. Robb and Bran and Rickon were his father¡¯s sons, and he loved them still, yet Jon knew that he had never truly been one of them. Catelyn Stark had seen to that. The grey walls of Winterfell might still haunt his dreams, but Castle Black was his life now, and his brothers were Sam and Grenn and Halder and Pyp and the other cast-outs who wore the black of the Night¡¯s Watch.
   ¡°My uncle spoke truly,¡± he whispered to Ghost. He wondered if he would ever see Benjen Stark again, to tell him.
   
   27£®EDDARD
   It¡¯s the Hand¡¯s tourney that¡¯s the cause of all the trouble, my lords,¡± the Commander of the City Watch complained to the king¡¯s council.
   ¡°The king¡¯s tourney,¡± Ned corrected, wincing. ¡°I assure you, the Hand wants no part of it.¡±
   ¡°Call it what you will, my lord. Knights have been arriving from all over the realm, and for every knight we get two freeriders, three craftsmen, six men-at-arms, a dozen merchants, two dozen whores, and more thieves than I dare guess. This cursed heat had half the city in a fever to start, and now with all these visitors?.?.?.?last night we had a drowning, a tavern riot, three knife fights, a rape, two fires, robberies beyond count, and a drunken horse race down the Street of the Sisters. The night before a woman¡¯s head was found in the Great Sept, floating in the rainbow pool. No one seems to know how it got there or who it belongs to.¡±
   ¡°How dreadful,¡± Varys said with a shudder.
   Lord Renly Baratheon was less sympathetic. ¡°If you cannot keep the king¡¯s peace, Janos, perhaps the City Watch should be commanded by someone who can.¡±
   Stout, jowly Janos Slynt puffed himself up like an angry frog, his bald pate reddening. ¡°Aegon the Dragon himself could not keep the peace, Lord Renly. I need more men.¡±
   ¡°How many?¡± Ned asked, leaning forward. As ever, Robert had not troubled himself to attend the council session, so it fell to his Hand to speak for him.
   ¡°As many as can be gotten, Lord Hand.¡±
   ¡°Hire fifty new men,¡± Ned told him. ¡°Lord Baelish will see that you get the coin.¡±
   ¡°I will?¡± Littlefinger said.
   ¡°You will. You found forty thousand golden dragons for a champion¡¯s purse, surely you can scrape together a few coppers to keep the king¡¯s peace.¡± Ned turned back to Janos Slynt. ¡°I will also give you twenty good swords from my own household guard, to serve with the Watch until the crowds have left.¡±
   ¡°All thanks, Lord Hand,¡± Slynt said, bowing. ¡°I promise you, they shall be put to good use.¡±
   When the Commander had taken his leave, Eddard Stark turned to the rest of the council. ¡°The sooner this folly is done with, the better I shall like it.¡± As if the expense and trouble were not irksome enough, all and sundry insisted on salting Ned¡¯s wound by calling it ¡°the Hand¡¯s tourney,¡± as if he were the cause of it. And Robert honestly seemed to think he should feel honored!
   ¡°The realm prospers from such events, my lord,¡± Grand Maester Pycelle said. ¡°They bring the great the chance of glory, and the lowly a respite from their woes.¡±
   ¡°And put coins in many a pocket,¡± Littlefinger added. ¡°Every inn in the city is full, and the whores are walking bowlegged and jingling with each step.¡±
   Lord Renly laughed. ¡°We¡¯re fortunate my brother Stannis is not with us. Remember the time he proposed to outlaw brothels? The king asked him if perhaps he¡¯d like to outlaw eating, shitting, and breathing while he was at it. If truth be told, I ofttimes wonder how Stannis ever got that ugly daughter of his. He goes to his marriage bed like a man marching to a battlefield, with a grim look in his eyes and a determination to do his duty.¡±
   Ned had not joined the laughter. ¡°I wonder about your brother Stannis as well. I wonder when he intends to end his visit to Dragonstone and resume his seat on this council.¡±
   ¡°No doubt as soon as we¡¯ve scourged all those whores into the sea,¡± Littlefinger replied, provoking more laughter.
   ¡°I have heard quite enough about whores for one day,¡± Ned said, rising. ¡°Until the morrow.¡±
   Harwin had the door when Ned returned to the Tower of the Hand. ¡°Summon Jory to my chambers and tell your father to saddle my horse,¡± Ned told him, too brusquely.
   ¡°As you say, my lord.¡±
   The Red Keep and the ¡°Hand¡¯s tourney¡± were chafing him raw, Ned reflected as he climbed. He yearned for the comfort of Catelyn¡¯s arms, for the sounds of Robb and Jon crossing swords in the practice yard, for the cool days and cold nights of the north.
   In his chambers he stripped off his council silks and sat for a moment with the book while he waited for Jory to arrive. The Lineages and Histories of the Great Houses of the Seven Kingdoms, With Descliptions of Many High Lords and Noble Ladies and Their Children, by Grand Maester Malleon. Pycelle had spoken truly; it made for ponderous reading. Yet Jon Arryn had asked for it, and Ned felt certain he had reasons. There was something here, some truth buried in these brittle yellow pages, if only he could see it. But what? The tome was over a century old. Scarcely a man now alive had yet been born when Malleon had compiled his dusty lists of weddings, births, and deaths.
   He opened to the section on House Lannister once more, and turned the pages slowly, hoping against hope that something would leap out at him. The Lannisters were an old family, tracing their descent back to Lann the Clever, a trickster from the Age of Heroes who was no doubt as legendary as Bran the Builder, though far more beloved of singers and taletellers. In the songs, Lann was the fellow who winkled the Casterlys out of Casterly Rock with no weapon but his wits, and stole gold from the sun to brighten his curly hair. Ned wished he were here now, to winkle the truth out of this damnable book.
   A sharp rap on the door heralded Jory Cassel. Ned closed Malleon¡¯s tome and bid him enter. ¡°I¡¯ve promised the City Watch twenty of my guard until the tourney is done,¡± he told him. ¡°I rely on you to make the choice. Give Alyn the command, and make certain the men understand that they are needed to stop fights, not start them.¡± Rising, Ned opened a cedar chest and removed a light linen undertunic. ¡°Did you find the stableboy?¡±
   ¡°The watchman, my lord,¡± Jory said. ¡°He vows he¡¯ll never touch another horse.¡±
   ¡°What did he have to say?¡±
   ¡°He claims he knew Lord Arryn well. Fast friends, they were.¡± Jory snorted. ¡°The Hand always gave the lads a copper on their name days, he says. Had a way with horses. Never rode his mounts too hard, and brought them carrots and apples, so they were always pleased to see him.¡±
   ¡°Carrots and apples,¡± Ned repeated. It sounded as if this boy would be even less use than the others. And he was the last of the four Littlefinger had turned up. Jory had spoken to each of them in turn. Ser Hugh had been brusque and uninformative, and arrogant as only a new-made knight can be. If the Hand wished to talk to him, he should be pleased to receive him, but he would not be questioned by a mere captain of guards?.?.?.?even if said captain was ten years older and a hundred times the swordsman. The serving girl had at least been pleasant. She said Lord Jon had been reading more than was good for him, that he was troubled and melancholy over his young son¡¯s frailty, and gruff with his lady wife. The potboy, now cordwainer, had never exchanged so much as a word with Lord Jon, but he was full of oddments of kitchen gossip: the lord had been quarreling with the king, the lord only picked at his food, the lord was sending his boy to be fostered on Dragonstone, the lord had taken a great interest in the breeding of hunting hounds, the lord had visited a master armorer to commission a new suit of plate, wrought all in pale silver with a blue jasper falcon and a mother-of-pearl moon on the breast. The king¡¯s own brother had gone with him to help choose the design, the potboy said. No, not Lord Renly, the other one, Lord Stannis.
   ¡°Did our watchman recall anything else of note?¡±
   ¡°The lad swears Lord Jon was as strong as a man half his age. Often went riding with Lord Stannis, he says.¡±
   Stannis again, Ned thought. He found that curious. Jon Arryn and he had been cordial, but never friendly. And while Robert had been riding north to Winterfell, Stannis had removed himself to Dragonstone, the Targaryen island fastness he had conquered in his brother¡¯s name. He had given no word as to when he might return. ¡°Where did they go on these rides?¡± Ned asked.
   ¡°The boy says that they visited a brothel.¡±
   ¡°A brothel?¡± Ned said. ¡°The Lord of the Eyrie and Hand of the King visited a brothel with Stannis Baratheon?¡± He shook his head, incredulous, wondering what Lord Renly would make of this tidbit. Robert¡¯s lusts were the subject of ribald drinking songs throughout the realm, but Stannis was a different sort of man; a bare year younger than the king, yet utterly unlike him, stern, humorless, unforgiving, grim in his sense of duty.
   ¡°The boy insists it¡¯s true. The Hand took three guardsmen with him, and the boy says they were joking of it when he took their horses afterward.¡±
   ¡°Which brothel?¡± Ned asked.
   ¡°The boy did not know. The guards would.¡±
   ¡°A pity Lysa carried them off to the Vale,¡± Ned said dryly. ¡°The gods are doing their best to vex us.Lady Lysa, Maester Colemon, Lord Stannis?.?.?.?everyone who might actually know the truth of what happened to Jon Arryn is a thousand leagues away.¡±
   ¡°Will you summon Lord Stannis back from Dragonstone?¡±
   ¡°Not yet,¡± Ned said. ¡°Not until I have a better notion of what this is all about and where he stands.¡± The matter nagged at him. Why did Stannis leave? Had he played some part in Jon Arryn¡¯s murder? Or was he afraid? Ned found it hard to imagine what could frighten Stannis Baratheon, who had once held Storm¡¯s End through a year of siege, surviving on rats and boot leather while the Lords Tyrell and Redwyne sat outside with their hosts, banqueting in sight of his walls.
   ¡°Bring me my doublet, if you would. The grey, with the direwolf sigil. I want this armorer to know who I am. It might make him more forthcoming.¡±
   Jory went to the wardrobe. ¡°Lord Renly is brother to Lord Stannis as well as the king.¡±
   ¡°Yet it seems that he was not invited on these rides.¡± Ned was not sure what to make of Renly, with all his friendly ways and easy smiles. A few days past, he had taken Ned aside to show him an exquisite rose gold locklet. Inside was a miniature painted in the vivid Myrish style, of a lovely young girl with doe¡¯s eyes and a cascade of soft brown hair. Renly had seemed anxious to know if the girl reminded him of anyone, and when Ned had no answer but a shrug, he had seemed disappointed. The maid was Loras Tyrell¡¯s sister Margaery, he¡¯d confessed, but there were those who said she looked like Lyanna. ¡°No,¡± Ned had told him, bemused. Could it be that Lord Renly, who looked so like a young Robert, had conceived a passion for a girl he fancied to be a young Lyanna? That struck him as more than passing queer.
   Jory held out the doublet, and Ned slid his hands through the armholes. ¡°Perhaps Lord Stannis will return for Robert¡¯s tourney,¡± he said as Jory laced the garment up the back.
   ¡°That would be a stroke of fortune, my lord,¡± Jory said.
   Ned buckled on a longsword. ¡°In other words, not bloody likely.¡± His smile was grim.
   Jory draped Ned¡¯s cloak across his shoulders and clasped it at the throat with the Hand¡¯s badge of office. ¡°The armorer lives above his shop, in a large house at the top of the Street of Steel. Alyn knows the way, my lord.¡±
   Ned nodded. ¡°The gods help this potboy if he¡¯s sent me off haring after shadows.¡± It was a slim enough staff to lean on, but the Jon Arryn that Ned Stark had known was not one to wear jeweled and silvered plate. Steel was steel; it was meant for protection, not ornament. He might have changed his views, to be sure. He would scarcely have been the first man who came to look on things differently after a few years at court?.?.?.?but the change was marked enough to make Ned wonder.
   ¡°Is there any other service I might perform?¡±
   ¡°I suppose you¡¯d best begin visiting whorehouses.¡±
   ¡°Hard duty, my lord.¡± Jory grinned. ¡°The men will be glad to help. Porther has made a fair start already.¡±
   Ned¡¯s favorite horse was saddled and waiting in the yard. Varly and Jacks fell in beside him as he rode through the yard. Their steel caps and shirts of mail must have been sweltering, yet they said no word of complaint. As Lord Eddard passed beneath the King¡¯s Gate into the stink of the city, his grey and white cloak streaming from his shoulders, he saw eyes everywhere and kicked his mount into a trot. His guard followed.
   He looked behind him frequently as they made their way through the crowded city streets. Tomard and Desmond had left the castle early this morning to take up positions on the route they must take, and watch for anyone following them, but even so, Ned was uncertain. The shadow of the King¡¯s Spider and his little birds had him fretting like a maiden on her wedding night.
   The Street of Steel began at the market square beside the River Gate, as it was named on maps, or the Mud Gate, as it was commonly called. A mummer on stilts was striding through the throngs like some great insect, with a horde of barefoot children trailing behind him, hooting. Elsewhere, two ragged boys no older than Bran were dueling with sticks, to the loud encouragement of some and the furious curses of others. An old woman ended the contest by leaning out of her window and emptying a bucket of slops on the heads of the combatants. In the shadow of the wall, farmers stood beside their wagons, bellowing out, ¡°Apples, the best apples, cheap at twice the price,¡± and ¡°Blood melons, sweet as honey,¡± and ¡°Turnips, onions, roots, here you go here, here you go, turnips, onions, roots, here you go here.¡±
   The Mud Gate was open, and a squad of City Watchmen stood under the portcullis in their golden cloaks, leaning on spears. When a column of riders appeared from the west, the guardsmen sprang into action, shouting commands and moving the carts and foot traffic aside to let the knight enter with his escort. The first rider through the gate carried a long black banner. The silk rippled in the wind like a living thing; across the fabric was blazoned a night sky slashed with purple lightning. ¡°Make way for Lord Beric!¡± the rider shouted. ¡°Make way for Lord Beric!¡± And close behind came the young lord himself, a dashing figure on a black courser, with red-gold hair and a black satin cloak dusted with stars. ¡°Here to fight in the Hand¡¯s tourney, my lord?¡± a guardsman called out to him. ¡°Here to win the Hand¡¯s tourney,¡± Lord Beric shouted back as the crowd cheered.
   Ned turned off the square where the Street of Steel began and followed its winding path up a long hill, past blacksmiths working at open forges, freeriders haggling over mail shirts, and grizzled ironmongers selling old blades and razors from their wagons. The farther they climbed, the larger the buildings grew. The man they wanted was all the way at the top of the hill, in a huge house of timber and plaster whose upper stories loomed over the narrow street. The double doors showed a hunting scene carved in ebony and weirwood. A pair of stone knights stood sentry at the entrance, armored in fanciful suits of polished red steel that transformed them into griffin and unicorn. Ned left his horse with Jacks and shouldered his way inside.
   The slim young serving girl took quick note of Ned¡¯s badge and the sigil on his doublet, and the master came hurrying out, all smiles and bows. ¡°Wine for the King¡¯s Hand,¡± he told the girl, gesturing Ned to a couch. ¡°I am Tobho Mott, my lord, please, please, put yourself at ease.¡± He wore a black velvet coat with hammers embroidered on the sleeves in silver thread, Around his neck was a heavy silver chain and a sapphire as large as a pigeon¡¯s egg. ¡°If you are in need of new arms for the Hand¡¯s tourney, you have come to the right shop.¡± Ned did not bother to correct him. ¡°My work is costly, and I make no apologies for that, my lord,¡± he said as he filled two matching silver goblets. ¡°You will not find craftsmanship equal to mine anywhere in the Seven Kingdoms, I promise you. Visit every forge in King¡¯s Landing if you like, and compare for yourself. Any village smith can hammer out a shirt of mail; my work is art.¡±
   Ned sipped his wine and let the man go on. The Knight of Flowers bought all his armor here, Tobho boasted, and many high lords, the ones who knew fine steel, and even Lord Renly, the king¡¯s own brother. Perhaps the Hand had seen Lord Renly¡¯s new armor, the green plate with the golden antlers? No other armorer in the city could get that deep a green; he knew the secret of putting color in the steel itself, paint and enamel were the crutches of a journeyman. Or mayhaps the Hand wanted a blade? Tobho had learned to work Valyrian steel at the forges of Qohor as a boy. Only a man who knew the spells could take old weapons and forge them anew. ¡°The direwolf is the sigil of House Stark, is it not? I could fashion a direwolf helm so real that children will run from you in the street,¡± he vowed.
   Ned smiled. ¡°Did you make a falcon helm for Lord Arryn?¡±
   Tobho Mott paused a long moment and set aside his wine. ¡°The Hand did call upon me, with Lord Stannis, the king¡¯s brother. I regret to say, they did not honor me with their patronage.¡±
   Ned looked at the man evenly, saying nothing, waiting. He had found over the years that silence sometimes yielded more than questions. And so it was this time.
   ¡°They asked to see the boy,¡± the armorer said, ¡°so I took them back to the forge.¡±
   ¡°The boy,¡± Ned echoed. He had no notion who the boy might be. ¡°I should like to see the boy as well.¡±
   Tobho Mott gave him a cool, careful look. ¡°As you wish, my lord,¡± he said with no trace of his former friendliness. He led Ned out a rear door and across a narrow yard, back to the cavernous stone barn where the work was done. When the armorer opened the door, the blast of hot air that came through made Ned feel as though he were walking into a dragon¡¯s mouth. Inside, a forge blazed in each corner, and the air stank of smoke and sulfur. Journeymen armorers glanced up from their hammers and tongs just long enough to wipe the sweat from their brows, while bare-chested apprentice boys worked the bellows.
   The master called over a tall lad about Robb¡¯s age, his arms and chest corded with muscle. ¡°This is Lord Stark, the new Hand of the King,¡± he told him as the boy looked at Ned through sullen blue eyes and pushed back sweat-soaked hair with his fingers. Thick hair, shaggy and unkempt and black as ink. The shadow of a new beard darkened his jaw. ¡°This is Gendry. Strong for his age, and he works hard. Show the Hand that helmet you made, lad.¡± Almost shyly, the boy led them to his bench, and a steel helm shaped like a bull¡¯s head, with two great curving horns.
   Ned turned the helm over in his hands. It was raw steel, unpolished but expertly shaped. ¡°This is fine work. I would be pleased if you would let me buy it.¡±
   The boy snatched it out of his hands. ¡°It¡¯s not for sale.¡±
   Tobho Mott looked horror-struck. ¡°Boy, this is the King¡¯s Hand. If his lordship wants this helm, make him a gift of it. He honors you by asking.¡±
   ¡°I made it for me,¡± the boy said stubbornly.
   ¡°A hundred pardons, my lord,¡± his master said hurriedly to Ned. ¡°The boy is crude as new steel, and like new steel would profit from some beating. That helm is journeyman¡¯s work at best. Forgive him and I promise I will craft you a helm like none you have ever seen.¡±
   ¡°He¡¯s done nothing that requires my forgiveness. Gendry, when Lord Arryn came to see you, what did you talk about?¡±
   ¡°He asked me questions is all, m¡¯lord.¡±
   ¡°What sort of questions?¡±
   The boy shrugged. ¡°How was I, and was I well treated, and if I liked the work, and stuff about my mother. Who she was and what she looked like and all.¡±
   ¡°What did you tell him?¡± Ned asked.
   The boy shoved a fresh fall of black hair off his forehead. ¡°She died when I was little. She had yellow hair, and sometimes she used to sing to me, I remember. She worked in an alehouse.¡±
   ¡°Did Lord Stannis question you as well?¡±
   ¡°The bald one? No, not him. He never said no word, just glared at me, like I was some raper who done for his daughter.¡±
   ¡°Mind your filthy tongue,¡± the master said. ¡°This is the King¡¯s own Hand.¡± The boy lowered his eyes. ¡°A smart boy, but stubborn. That helm?.?.?.? the others call him bullheaded, so he threw it in their teeth.¡±
   Ned touched the boy¡¯s head, fingering the thick black hair. ¡°Look at me, Gendry.¡± The apprentice lifted his face. Ned studied the shape of his jaw, the eyes like blue ice. Yes, he thought, I see it. ¡°Go back to your work, lad. I¡¯m sorry to have bothered you.¡± He walked back to the house with the master. ¡°Who paid the boy¡¯s apprentice fee?¡± he asked lightly.
   Mott looked fretful. ¡°You saw the boy. Such a strong boy. Those hands of his, those hands were made for hammers. He had such promise, I took him on without a fee.¡±
   ¡°The truth now,¡± Ned urged. ¡°The streets are full of strong boys. The day you take on an apprentice without a fee will be the day the Wall comes down. Who paid for him?¡±
   ¡°A lord,¡± the master said reluctantly. ¡°He gave no name, and wore no sigil on his coat. He paid in gold, twice the customary sum, and said he was paying once for the boy, and once for my silence.¡±
   ¡°Describe him.¡±
   ¡°He was stout, round of shoulder, not so tall as you. Brown beard, but there was a bit of red in it, I¡¯ll swear. He wore a rich cloak, that I do remember, heavy purple velvet worked with silver threads, but the hood shadowed his face and I never did see him clear.¡± He hesitated a moment. ¡°My lord, I want no trouble.¡±
   ¡°None of us wants trouble, but I fear these are troubled times, Master Mott,¡± Ned said. ¡°You know who the boy is.¡±
   ¡°I am only an armorer, my lord. I know what I¡¯m told.¡±
   ¡°You know who the boy is,¡± Ned repeated patiently. ¡°That is not a question.¡±
   ¡°The boy is my apprentice,¡± the master said. He looked Ned in the eye, stubborn as old iron. ¡°Who he was before he came to me, that¡¯s none of my concern.¡±
   Ned nodded. He decided that he liked Tobho Mott, master armorer. ¡°If the day ever comes when Gendry would rather wield a sword than forge one, send him to me. He has the look of a warrior. Until then, you have my thanks, Master Mott, and my promise. Should I ever want a helm to frighten children, this will be the first place I visit.¡±
   His guard was waiting outside with the horses. ¡°Did you find anything, my lord?¡± Jacks asked as Ned mounted up.
   ¡°I did,¡± Ned told him, wondering. What had Jon Arryn wanted with a king¡¯s bastard, and why was it worth his life?
   
   28£®CATELYN
   My lady, you ought cover your head,¡± Ser Rodrik told her as their horses plodded north. ¡°You will take a chill.¡±
   ¡°It is only water, Ser Rodrik,¡± Catelyn replied. Her hair hung wet and heavy, a loose strand stuck to her forehead, and she could imagine how ragged and wild she must look, but for once she did not care. The southern rain was soft and warm. Catelyn liked the feel of it on her face, gentle as a mother¡¯s kisses. It took her back to her childhood, to long grey days at Riverrun. She remembered the godswood, drooping branches heavy with moisture, and the sound of her brother¡¯s laughter as he chased her through piles of damp leaves. She remembered making mud pies with Lysa, the weight of them, the mud slick and brown between her fingers. They had served them to Littlefinger, giggling, and he¡¯d eaten so much mud he was sick for a week. How young they all had been.
   Catelyn had almost forgotten. In the north, the rain fell cold and hard, and sometimes at night it turned to ice. It was as likely to kill a crop as nurture it, and it sent grown men running for the nearest shelter. That was no rain for little girls to play in.
   ¡°I am soaked through,¡± Ser Rodrik complained. ¡°Even my bones are wet.¡± The woods pressed close around them, and the steady pattering of rain on leaves was accompanied by the small sucking sounds their horses made as their hooves pulled free of the mud. ¡°We will want a fire tonight, my lady, and a hot meal would serve us both.¡±
   ¡°There is an inn at the crossroads up ahead,¡± Catelyn told him. She had slept many a night there in her youth, traveling with her father. Lord Hoster Tully had been a restless man in his prime, always riding somewhere. She still remembered the innkeep, a fat woman named Masha Heddle who chewed sourleaf night and day and seemed to have an endless supply of smiles and sweet cakes for the children. The sweet cakes had been soaked with honey, rich and heavy on the tongue, but how Catelyn had dreaded those smiles. The sourleaf had stained Masha¡¯s teeth a dark red, and made her smile a bloody horror.
   ¡°An inn,¡± Ser Rodrik repeated wistfully. ¡°If only?.?.?.?but we dare not risk it. If we wish to remain unknown, I think it best we seek out some small holdfast?.?.?.?¡± He broke off as they heard sounds up the road; splashing water, the clink of mail, a horse¡¯s whinny. ¡°Riders,¡± he warned, his hand dropping to the hilt of his sword. Even on the kingsroad, it never hurt to be wary.
   They followed the sounds around a lazy bend of the road and saw them; a column of armed men noisily fording a swollen stream. Catelyn reined up to let them pass. The banner in the hand of the foremost rider hung sodden and limp, but the guardsmen wore indigo cloaks and on their shoulders flew the silver eagle of Seagard. ¡°Mallisters,¡± Ser Rodrik whispered to her, as if she had not known. ¡°My lady, best pull up your hood.¡±
   Catelyn made no move. Lord Jason Mallister himself rode with them, surrounded by his knights, his son Patrek by his side and their squires close behind. They were riding for King¡¯s Landing and the Hand¡¯s tourney, she knew. For the past week, the travelers had been thick as flies upon the kingsroad; knights and freeriders, singers with their harps and drums, heavy wagons laden with hops or corn or casks of honey, traders and craftsmen and whores, and all of them moving south.
   She studied Lord Jason boldly. The last time she had seen him he had been jesting with her uncle at her wedding feast; the Mallisters stood bannermen to the Tullys, and his gifts had been lavish. His brown hair was salted with white now, his face chiseled gaunt by time, yet the years had not touched his pride. He rode like a man who feared nothing. Catelyn envied him that; she had come to fear so much. As the riders passed, Lord Jason nodded a curt greeting, but it was only a high lord¡¯s courtesy to strangers chance met on the road. There was no recognition in those fierce eyes, and his son did not even waste a look.
   ¡°He did not know you,¡± Ser Rodrik said after, wondering.
   ¡°He saw a pair of mud-spattered travelers by the side of the road, wet and tired. It would never occur to him to suspect that one of them was the daughter of his liege lord. I think we shall be safe enough at the inn, Ser Rodrik.¡±
   It was near dark when they reached it, at the crossroads north of the great confluence of the Trident. Masha Heddle was fatter and greyer than Catelyn remembered, still chewing her sourleaf, but she gave them only the most cursory of looks, with nary a hint of her ghastly red smile. ¡°Two rooms at the top of the stair, that¡¯s all there is,¡± she said, chewing all the while. ¡°They¡¯re under the bell tower, you won¡¯t be missing meals, though there¡¯s some thinks it too noisy. Can¡¯t be helped. We¡¯re full up, or near as makes no matter. It¡¯s those rooms or the road.¡±
   It was those rooms, low, dusty garrets at the top of a cramped narrow staircase. ¡°Leave your boots down here,¡± Masha told them after she¡¯d taken their coin. ¡°The boy will clean them. I won¡¯t have you tracking mud up my stairs. Mind the bell. Those who come late to meals don¡¯t eat.¡± There were no smiles, and no mention of sweet cakes.
   When the supper bell rang, the sound was deafening. Catelyn had changed into dry clothes. She sat by the window, watching rain run down the pane. The glass was milky and full of bubbles, and a wet dusk was falling outside. Catelyn could just make out the muddy crossing where the two great roads met.
   The crossroads gave her pause. If they turned west from here, it was an easy ride down to Riverrun. Her father had always given her wise counsel when she needed it most, and she yearned to talk to him, to warn him of the gathering storm. If Winterfell needed to brace for war, how much more so Riverrun, so much closer to King¡¯s Landing, with the power of Casterly Rock looming to the west like a shadow. If only her father had been stronger, she might have chanced it, but Hoster Tully had been bedridden these past two years, and Catelyn was loath to tax him now.
   The eastern road was wilder and more dangerous, climbing through rocky foothills and thick forests into the Mountains of the Moon, past high passes and deep chasms to the Vale of Arryn and the stony Fingers beyond. Above the Vale, the Eyrie stood high and impregnable, its towers reaching for the sky. There she would find her sister?.?.?.?and, perhaps, some of the answers Ned sought. Surely Lysa knew more than she had dared to put in her letter. She might have the very proof that Ned needed to bring the Lannisters to ruin, and if it came to war, they would need the Arryns and the eastern lords who owed them service.
   Yet the mountain road was perilous. Shadowcats prowled those passes, rock slides were common, and the mountain clans were lawless brigands, descending from the heights to rob and kill and melting away like snow whenever the knights rode out from the Vale in search of them. Even Jon Arryn, as great a lord as any the Eyrie had ever known, had always traveled in strength when he crossed the mountains. Catelyn¡¯s only strength was one elderly knight, armored in loyalty.
   No, she thought, Riverrun and the Eyrie would have to wait. Her path ran north to Winterfell, where her sons and her duty were waiting for her. As soon as they were safely past the Neck, she could declare herself to one of Ned¡¯s bannermen, and send riders racing ahead with orders to mount a watch on the kingsroad.
   The rain obscured the fields beyond the crossroads, but Catelyn saw the land clear enough in her memory. The marketplace was just across the way, and the village a mile farther on, half a hundred white cottages surrounding a small stone sept. There would be more now; the summer had been long and peaceful. North of here the kingsroad ran along the Green Fork of the Trident, through fertile valleys and green woodlands, past thriving towns and stout holdfasts and the castles of the river lords.
   Catelyn knew them all: the Blackwoods and the Brackens, ever enemies, whose quarrels her father was obliged to settle; Lady Whent, last of her line, who dwelt with her ghosts in the cavernous vaults of Harrenhal; irascible Lord Frey, who had outlived seven wives and filled his twin castles with children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren, and bastards and grandbastards as well. All of them were bannermen to the Tullys, their swords sworn to the service of Riverrun. Catelyn wondered if that would be enough, if it came to war. Her father was the staunchest man who¡¯d ever lived, and she had no doubt that he would call his banners?.?.?.?but would the banners come? The Darrys and Rygers and Mootons had sworn oaths to Riverrun as well, yet they had fought with Rhaegar Targaryen on the Trident, while Lord Frey had arrived with his levies well after the battle was over, leaving some doubt as to which army he had planned to join (theirs, he had assured the victors solemnly in the aftermath, but ever after her father had called him the Late Lord Frey). It must not come to war, Catelyn thought fervently. They must not let it.
   Ser Rodrik came for her just as the bell ceased its clangor. ¡°We had best make haste if we hope to eat tonight, my lady.¡±
   ¡°It might be safer if we were not knight and lady until we pass the Neck,¡± she told him. ¡°Common travelers attract less notice. A father and daughter taken to the road on some family business, say.¡±
   ¡°As you say, my lady,¡± Ser Rodrik agreed. It was only when she laughed that he realized what he¡¯d done. ¡°The old courtesies die hard, my, my daughter.¡± He tried to tug on his missing whiskers, and sighed with exasperation.
   Catelyn took his arm. ¡°Come, Father,¡± she said. ¡°You¡¯ll find that Masha Heddle sets a good table, I think, but try not to praise her. You truly don¡¯t want to see her smile.¡±
   The common room was long and drafty, with a row of huge wooden kegs at one end and a fireplace at the other. A serving boy ran back and forth with skewers of meat while Masha drew beer from the kegs, chewing her sourleaf all the while.
   The benches were crowded, townsfolk and farmers mingling freely with all manner of travelers. The crossroads made for odd companions; dyers with black and purple hands shared a bench with rivermen reeking of fish, an ironsmith thick with muscle squeezed in beside a wizened old septon, hard-bitten sellswords and soft plump merchants swapped news like boon companions.
   The company included more swords than Catelyn would have liked. Three by the fire wore the red stallion badge of the Brackens, and there was a large party in blue steel ringmail and capes of a silvery grey. On their shoulder was another familiar sigil, the twin towers of House Frey. She studied their faces, but they were all too young to have known her. The senior among them would have been no older than Bran when she went north.
   Ser Rodrik found them an empty place on the bench near the kitchen. Across the table a handsome youth was fingering a woodharp. ¡°Seven blessings to you, goodfolk,¡± he said as they sat. An empty wine cup stood on the table before him.
   ¡°And to you, singer,¡± Catelyn returned. Ser Rodrik called for bread and meat and beer in a tone that meant now. The singer, a youth of some eighteen years, eyed them boldly and asked where they were going, and from whence they had come, and what news they had, letting the questions fly as quick as arrows and never pausing for an answer. ¡°We left King¡¯s Landing a fortnight ago,¡± Catelyn replied, answering the safest of his questions.
   ¡°That¡¯s where I¡¯m bound,¡± the youth said. As she had suspected, he was more interested in telling his own story than in hearing theirs. Singers loved nothing half so well as the sound of their own voices. ¡°The Hand¡¯s tourney means rich lords with fat purses. The last time I came away with more silver than I could carry?.?.?.?or would have, if I hadn¡¯t lost it all betting on the Kingslayer to win the day.¡±
   ¡°The gods frown on the gambler,¡± Ser Rodrik said sternly. He was of the north, and shared the Stark views on tournaments.
   ¡°They frowned on me, for certain,¡± the singer said. ¡°Your cruel gods and the Knight of Flowers altogether did me in.¡±
   ¡°No doubt that was a lesson for you,¡± Ser Rodrik said.
   ¡°It was. This time my coin will champion Ser Loras.¡±
   Ser Rodrik tried to tug at whiskers that were not there, but before he could frame a rebuke the serving boy came scurrying up. He laid trenchers of bread before them and filled them with chunks of browned meat off a skewer, dripping with hot juice. Another skewer held tiny onions, fire peppers, and fat mushrooms. Ser Rodrik set to lustily as the lad ran back to fetch them beer.
   ¡°My name is Marillion,¡± the singer said, plucking a string on his woodharp. ¡°Doubtless you¡¯ve heard me play somewhere?¡±
   His manner made Catelyn smile. Few wandering singers ever ventured as far north as Winterfell, but she knew his like from her girlhood in Riverrun. ¡°I fear not,¡± she told him.
   He drew a plaintive chord from the woodharp. ¡°That is your loss,¡± he said. ¡°Who was the finest singer you¡¯ve ever heard?¡±
   ¡°Alia of Braavos,¡± Ser Rodrik answered at once.
   ¡°Oh, I¡¯m much better than that old stick,¡± Marillion said. ¡°If you have the silver for a song, I¡¯ll gladly show you.¡±
   ¡°I might have a copper or two, but I¡¯d sooner toss it down a well than pay for your howling,¡± Ser Rodrik groused. His opinion of singers was well known; music was a lovely thing for girls, but he could not comprehend why any healthy boy would fill his hand with a harp when he might have had a sword.
   ¡°Your grandfather has a sour nature,¡± Marillion said to Catelyn. ¡°I meant to do you honor. An homage to your beauty. In truth, I was made to sing for kings and high lords.¡±
   ¡°Oh, I can see that,¡± Catelyn said. ¡°Lord Tully is fond of song, I hear. No doubt you¡¯ve been to Riverrun.¡±
   ¡°A hundred times,¡± the singer said airily. ¡°They keep a chamber for me, and the young lord is like a brother.¡±
   Catelyn smiled, wondering what Edmure would think of that. Another singer had once bedded a girl her brother fancied; he had hated the breed ever since. ¡°And Winterfell?¡± she asked him. ¡°Have you traveled north?¡±
   ¡°Why would I?¡¯ Marillion asked. ¡°It¡¯s all blizzards and bearskins up there, and the Starks know no music but the howling of wolves.¡± Distantly, she was aware of the door banging open at the far end of the room.
   ¡°Innkeep,¡± a servant¡¯s voice called out behind her, ¡°we have horses that want stabling, and my lord of Lannister requires a room and a hot bath.¡±
   ¡°Oh, gods,¡± Ser Rodrik said before Catelyn reached out to silence him, her fingers tightening hard around his forearm.
   Masha Heddle was bowing and smiling her hideous red smile. ¡°I¡¯m sorry, m¡¯lord, truly, we¡¯re full up, every room.¡±
   There were four of them, Catelyn saw. An old man in the black of the Night¡¯s Watch, two servants?.?.?.?and him, standing there small and bold as life. ¡°My men will steep in your stable, and as for myself, well, I do not require a large room, as you can plainly see.¡± He flashed a mocking grin. ¡°So long as the fire¡¯s warm and the straw reasonably free of fleas, I am a happy man.¡±
   Masha Heddle was beside herself. ¡°M¡¯lord, there¡¯s nothing, it¡¯s the tourney, there¡¯s no help for it, oh?.?.?.?¡±
   Tyrion Lannister pulled a coin from his purse and flicked it up over his head, caught it, tossed it again. Even across the room, where Catelyn sat, the wink of gold was unmistakable.
   A freerider in a faded blue cloak lurched to his feet. ¡°You¡¯re welcome to my room, m¡¯lord.¡±
   ¡°Now there¡¯s a clever man,¡± Lannister said as he sent the coin spinning across the room. The freerider snatched it from the air. ¡°And a nimble one to boot.¡± The dwarf turned back to Masha Heddle. ¡°You will be able to manage food, I trust?¡±
   ¡°Anything you like, m¡¯lord, anything at all,¡± the innkeep promised. And may he choke on it, Catelyn thought, but it was Bran she saw choking, drowning on his own blood.
   Lannister glanced at the nearest tables. ¡°My men will have whatever you¡¯re serving these people. Double portions, we¡¯ve had a long hard ride. I¡¯ll take a roast fowl, chicken, duck, pigeon, it makes no matter. And send up a flagon of your best wine. Yoren, will you sup with me?¡±
   ¡°Aye, m¡¯lord, I will,¡± the black brother replied.
   The dwarf had not so much as glanced toward the far end of the room, and Catelyn was thinking how grateful she was for the crowded benches between them when suddenly Marillion bounded to his feet. ¡°My lord of Lannister!¡± he called out. ¡°I would be pleased to entertain you while you eat. Let me sing you the lay of your father¡¯s great victory at King¡¯s Landing!¡±
   ¡°Nothing would be more likely to ruin my supper,¡± the dwarf said dryly. His mismatched eyes considered the singer briefly, started to move away?.?.?.?and found Catelyn. He looked at her for a moment, puzzled. She turned her face away, but too late. The dwarf was smiling. ¡°Lady Stark, what an unexpected pleasure,¡± he said. ¡°I was sorry to miss you at Winterfell.¡±
   Marillion gaped at her, confusion giving way to chagrin as Catelyn rose slowly to her feet. She heard Ser Rodrik curse. If only the man had lingered at the Wall, she thought, if only?.?.?.?
   ¡°Lady?.?.?.?Stark?¡± Masha Heddle said thickly.
   ¡°I was still Catelyn Tully the last time I bedded here,¡± she told the innkeep. She could hear the muttering, feel the eyes upon her. Catelyn glanced around the room, at the faces of the knights and sworn swords, and took a deep breath to slow the frantic beating of her heart. Did she dare take the risk? There was no time to think it through, only the moment and the sound of her own voice ringing in her ears. ¡°You in the corner,¡± she said to an older man she had not noticed until now. ¡°Is that the black bat of Harrenhal I see embroidered on your surcoat, ser?¡±
   The man got to his feet. ¡°It is, my lady.¡±
   ¡°And is Lady Whent a true and honest friend to my father, Lord Hoster Tully of Riverrun?¡±
   ¡°She is,¡± the man replied stoutly.
   Ser Rodrik rose quietly and loosened his sword in its scabbard. The dwarf was blinking at them, blank-faced, with puzzlement in his mismatched eyes.
   ¡°The red stallion was ever a welcome sight in Riverrun,¡± she said to the trio by the fire. ¡°My father counts Jonos Bracken among his oldest and most loyal bannermen.¡±
   The three men-at-arms exchanged uncertain looks. ¡°Our lord is honored by his trust,¡± one of them said hesitantly.
   ¡°I envy your father all these fine friends,¡± Lannister quipped, ¡°but I do not quite see the purpose of this, Lady Stark.¡±
   She ignored him, turning to the large party in blue and grey. They were the heart of the matter; there were more than twenty of them. ¡°I know your sigil as well: the twin towers of Frey. How fares your good lord, sers?¡±
   Their captain rose. ¡°Lord Walder is well, my lady. He plans to take a new wife on his ninetieth name day, and has asked your lord father to honor the wedding with his presence.¡±
   Tyrion Lannister sniggered. That was when Catelyn knew he was hers. ¡°This man came a guest into my house, and there conspired to murder my son, a boy of seven,¡± she proclaimed to the room at large, pointing. Ser Rodrik moved to her side, his sword in hand. ¡°In the name of King Robert and the good lords you serve, I call upon you to seize him and help me return him to Winterfell to await the king¡¯s justice.¡±
   She did not know what was more satisfying: the sound of a dozen swords drawn as one or the look on Tyrion Lannister¡¯s face.
   
   29£®SANSA
   Sansa rode to the Hand¡¯s tourney with Septa Mordane and Jeyne Poole, in a litter with curtains of yellow silk so fine she could see right through them. They turned the whole world gold. Beyond the city walls, a hundred pavilions had been raised beside the river, and the common folk came out in the thousands to watch the games. The splendor of it all took Sansa¡¯s breath away; the shining armor, the great chargers caparisoned in silver and gold, the shouts of the crowd, the banners snapping in the wind?.?.?.?and the knights themselves, the knights most of all.
   ¡°It is better than the songs,¡± she whispered when they found the places that her father had promised her, among the high lords and ladies. Sansa was dressed beautifully that day, in a green gown that brought out the auburn of her hair, and she knew they were looking at her and smiling.
   They watched the heroes of a hundred songs ride forth, each more fabulous than the last. The seven knights of the Kingsguard took the field, all but Jaime Lannister in scaled armor the color of milk, their cloaks as white as freshfallen snow. Ser Jaime wore the white cloak as well, but beneath it he was shining gold from head to foot, with a lion¡¯s-head helm and a golden sword. Ser Gregor Clegane, the Mountain That Rides, thundered past them like an avalanche. Sansa remembered Lord Yohn Royce, who had guested at Winterfell two years before. ¡°His armor is bronze, thousands and thousands of years old, engraved with magic runes that ward him against harm,¡± she whispered to Jeyne. Septa Mordane pointed out Lord Jason Mallister, in indigo chased with silver, the wings of an eagle on his helm. He had cut down three of Rhaegar¡¯s bannermen on the Trident. The girls giggled over the warrior priest Thoros of Myr, with his flapping red robes and shaven head, until the septa told them that he had once scaled the walls of Pyke with a flaming sword in hand.
   Other riders Sansa did not know; hedge knights from the Fingers and Highgarden and the mountains of Dorne, unsung freeriders and new-made squires, the younger sons of high lords and the heirs of lesser houses. Younger men, most had done no great deeds as yet, but Sansa and Jeyne agreed that one day the Seven Kingdoms would resound to the sound of their names. Ser Balon Swann. Lord Bryce Caron of the Marches. Bronze Yohn¡¯s heir, Ser Andar Royce, and his younger brother Ser Robar, their silvered steel plate filigreed in bronze with the same ancient runes that warded their father. The twins Ser Horas and Ser Hobber, whose shields displayed the grape cluster sigil of the Redwynes, burgundy on blue. Patrek Mallister, Lord Jason¡¯s son. Six Freys of the Crossing: Ser Jared, Ser Hosteen, Ser Danwell, Ser Emmon, Ser Theo, Ser Perwyn, sons and grandsons of old Lord Walder Frey, and his bastard son Martyn Rivers as well.
   Jeyne Poole confessed herself frightened by the look of Jalabhar Xho, an exile prince from the Summer Isles who wore a cape of green and scarlet feathers over skin as dark as night, but when she saw young Lord Beric Dondarrion, with his hair like red gold and his black shield slashed by lightning, she pronounced herself willing to marry him on the instant.
   The Hound entered the lists as well, and so too the king¡¯s brother, handsome Lord Renly of Storm¡¯s End. Jory, Alyn, and Harwin rode for Winterfell and the north. ¡°Jory looks a beggar among these others,¡± Septa Mordane sniffed when he appeared. Sansa could only agree. Jory¡¯s armor was blue-grey plate without device or ornament, and a thin grey cloak hung from his shoulders like a soiled rag. Yet he acquitted himself well, unhorsing Horas Redwyne in his first joust and one of the Freys in his second. In his third match, he rode three passes at a freerider named Lothor Brune whose armor was as drab as his own. Neither man lost his seat, but Brune¡¯s lance was steadier and his blows better placed, and the king gave him the victory. Alyn and Harwin fared less well; Harwin was unhorsed in his first tilt by Ser Meryn of the Kingsguard, while Alyn fell to Ser Balon Swann.
   The jousting went all day and into the dusk, the hooves of the great warhorses pounding down the lists until the field was a ragged wasteland of torn earth. A dozen times Jeyne and Sansa cried out in unison as riders crashed together, lances exploding into splinters while the commons screamed for their favorites. Jeyne covered her eyes whenever a man fell, like a frightened little girl, but Sansa was made of sterner stuff. A great lady knew how to behave at tournaments. Even Septa Mordane noted her composure and nodded in approval.
   The Kingslayer rode brilliantly. He overthrew Ser Andar Royce and the Marcher Lord Bryce Caron as easily as if he were riding at rings, and then took a hard-fought match from white-haired Barristan Selmy, who had won his first two tilts against men thirty and forty years his junior.
   Sandor Clegane and his immense brother, Ser Gregor the Mountain, seemed unstoppable as well, riding down one foe after the next in ferocious style. The most terrifying moment of the day came during Ser Gregor¡¯s second joust, when his lance rode up and struck a young knight from the Vale under the gorget with such force that it drove through his throat, killing him instantly. The youth fell not ten feet from where Sansa was seated. The point of Ser Gregor¡¯s lance had snapped off in his neck, and his life¡¯s blood flowed out in slow pulses, each weaker than the one before. His armor was shiny new; a bright streak of fire ran down his outstretched arm, as the steel caught the light. Then the sun went behind a cloud, and it was gone. His cloak was blue, the color of the sky on a clear summer¡¯s day, trimmed with a border of crescent moons, but as his blood seeped into it, the cloth darkened and the moons turned red, one by one.
   Jeyne Poole wept so hysterically that Septa Mordane finally took her off to regain her composure, but Sansa sat with her hands folded in her lap, watching with a strange fascination. She had never seen a man die before. She ought to be crying too, she thought, but the tears would not come. Perhaps she had used up all her tears for Lady and Bran. It would be different if it had been Jory or Ser Rodrik or Father, she told herself. The young knight in the blue cloak was nothing to her, some stranger from the Vale of Arryn whose name she had forgotten as soon as she heard it. And now the world would forget his name too, Sansa realized; there would be no songs sung for him. That was sad.
   After they carried off the body, a boy with a spade ran onto the field and shoveled dirt over the spot where he had fallen, to cover up the blood. Then the jousts resumed.
   Ser Balon Swann also fell to Gregor, and Lord Renly to the Hound. Renly was unhorsed so violently that he seemed to fly backward off his charger, legs in the air. His head hit the ground with an audible crack that made the crowd gasp, but it was just the golden antler on his helm. One of the tines had snapped off beneath him. When Lord Renly climbed to his feet, the commons cheered wildly, for King Robert¡¯s handsome young brother was a great favorite. He handed the broken tine to his conqueror with a gracious bow. The Hound snorted and tossed the broken antler into the crowd, where the commons began to punch and claw over the little bit of gold, until Lord Renly walked out among them and restored the peace. By then Septa Mordane had returned, alone. Jeyne had been feeling ill, she explained; she had helped her back to the castle. Sansa had almost forgotten about Jeyne.
   Later a hedge knight in a checkered cloak disgraced himself by killing Beric Dondarrion¡¯s horse, and was declared forfeit. Lord Beric shifted his saddle to a new mount, only to be knocked right off it by Thoros of Myr. Ser Aron Santagar and Lothor Brune tilted thrice without result; Ser Aron fell afterward to Lord Jason Mallister, and Brune to Yohn Royce¡¯s younger son, Robar.
   In the end it came down to four; the Hound and his monstrous brother Gregor, Jaime Lannister the Kingslayer, and Ser Loras Tyrell, the youth they called the Knight of Flowers.
   Ser Loras was the youngest son of Mace Tyrell, the Lord of Highgarden and Warden of the South. At sixteen, he was the youngest rider on the field, yet he had unhorsed three knights of the Kingsguard that morning in his first three jousts. Sansa had never seen anyone so beautiful. His plate was intricately fashioned and enameled as a bouquet of a thousand different flowers, and his snow-white stallion was draped in a blanket of red and white roses. After each victory, Ser Loras would remove his helm and ride slowly round the fence, and finally pluck a single white rose from the blanket and toss it to some fair maiden in the crowd.
   His last match of the day was against the younger Royce. Ser Robar¡¯s ancestral runes proved small protection as Ser Loras split his shield and drove him from his saddle to crash with an awful clangor in the dirt. Robar lay moaning as the victor made his circuit of the field. Finally they called for a litter and carried him off to his tent, dazed and unmoving. Sansa never saw it. Her eyes were only for Ser Loras. When the white horse stopped in front of her, she thought her heart would burst.
   To the other maidens he had given white roses, but the one he plucked for her was red. ¡°Sweet lady,¡± he said, ¡°no victory is half so beautiful as you.¡± Sansa took the flower timidly, struck dumb by his gallantry. His hair was a mass of lazy brown curls, his eyes like liquid gold. She inhaled the sweet fragrance of the rose and sat clutching it long after Ser Loras had ridden off.
   When Sansa finally looked up, a man was standing over her, staring. He was short, with a pointed beard and a silver streak in his hair, almost as old as her father. ¡°You must be one of her daughters,¡± he said to her. He had grey-green eyes that did not smile when his mouth did. ¡°You have the Tully look.¡±
   ¡°I¡¯m Sansa Stark,¡± she said, ill at ease. The man wore a heavy cloak with a fur collar, fastened with a silver mockingbird, and he had the effortless manner of a high lord, but she did not know him. ¡°I have not had the honor, my lord.¡±
   Septa Mordane quickly took a hand. ¡°Sweet child, this is Lord Petyr Baelish, of the king¡¯s small council.¡±
   ¡°Your mother was my queen of beauty once,¡± the man said quietly. His breath smelled of mint. ¡°You have her hair.¡± His fingers brushed against her cheek as he stroked one auburn lock. Quite abruptly he turned and walked away.
   By then, the moon was well up and the crowd was tired, so the king decreed that the last three matches would be fought the next morning, before the melee. While the commons began their walk home, talking of the day¡¯s jousts and the matches to come on the morrow, the court moved to the riverside to begin the feast. Six monstrous huge aurochs had been roasting for hours, turning slowly on wooden spits while kitchen boys basted them with butter and herbs until the meat crackled and spit. Tables and benches had been raised outside the pavilions, piled high with sweetgrass and strawberries and fresh-baked bread.
   Sansa and Septa Mordane were given places of high honor, to the left of the raised dais where the king himself sat beside his queen. When Prince Joffrey seated himself to her right, she felt her throat tighten. He had not spoken a word to her since the awful thing had happened, and she had not dared to speak to him. At first she thought she hated him for what they¡¯d done to Lady, but after Sansa had wept her eyes dry, she told herself that it had not been Joffrey¡¯s doing, not truly. The queen had done it; she was the one to hate, her and Arya. Nothing bad would have happened except for Arya.
   She could not hate Joffrey tonight. He was too beautiful to hate. He wore a deep blue doublet studded with a double row of golden lion¡¯s heads, and around his brow a slim coronet made of gold and sapphires. His hair was as bright as the metal. Sansa looked at him and trembled, afraid that he might ignore her or, worse, turn hateful again and send her weeping from the table.
   Instead Joffrey smiled and kissed her hand, handsome and gallant as any prince in the songs, and said, ¡°Ser Loras has a keen eye for beauty, sweet lady.¡±
   ¡°He was too kind,¡± she demurred, trying to remain modest and calm, though her heart was singing. ¡°Ser Loras is a true knight. Do you think he will win tomorrow, my lord?¡±
   ¡°No,¡± Joffrey said. ¡°My dog will do for him, or perhaps my uncle Jaime. And in a few years, when I am old enough to enter the lists, I shall do for them all.¡± He raised his hand to summon a servant with a flagon of iced summerwine, and poured her a cup. She looked anxiously at Septa Mordane, until Joffrey leaned over and filled the septa¡¯s cup as well, so she nodded and thanked him graciously and said not another word.
   The servants kept the cups filled all night, yet afterward Sansa could not recall ever tasting the wine. She needed no wine. She was drunk on the magic of the night, giddy with glamour, swept away by beauties she had dreamt of all her life and never dared hope to know. Singers sat before the king¡¯s pavilion, filling the dusk with music. A juggler kept a cascade of burning clubs spinning through the air. The king¡¯s own fool, the pie-faced simpleton called Moon Boy, danced about on stilts, all in motley, making mock of everyone with such deft cruelty that Sansa wondered if he was simple after all. Even Septa Mordane was helpless before him; when he sang his little song about the High Septon, she laughed so hard she spilled wine on herself.
   And Joffrey was the soul of courtesy. He talked to Sansa all night, showering her with compliments, making her laugh, sharing little bits of court gossip, explaining Moon Boy¡¯s japes. Sansa was so captivated that she quite forgot all her courtesies and ignored Septa Mordane, seated to her left.
   All the while the courses came and went. A thick soup of barley and venison. Salads of sweetgrass and spinach and plums, sprinkled with crushed nuts. Snails in honey and garlic. Sansa had never eaten snails before; Joffrey showed her how to get the snail out of the shell, and fed her the first sweet morsel himself. Then came trout fresh from the river, baked in clay; her prince helped her crack open the hard casing to expose the flaky white flesh within. And when the meat course was brought out, he served her himself, slicing a queen¡¯s portion from the joint, smiling as he laid it on her plate. She could see from the way he moved that his right arm was still troubling him, yet he uttered not a word of complaint.
   Later came sweetbreads and pigeon pie and baked apples fragrant with cinnamon and lemon cakes frosted in sugar, but by then Sansa was so stuffed that she could not manage more than two little lemon cakes, as much as she loved them. She was wondering whether she might attempt a third when the king began to shout.
   King Robert had grown louder with each course. From time to time Sansa could hear him laughing or roaring a command over the music and the clangor of plates and cutlery, but they were too far away for her to make out his words.
   Now everybody heard him. ¡°No,¡± he thundered in a voice that drowned out all other speech. Sansa was shocked to see the king on his feet, red of face, reeling. He had a goblet of wine in one hand, and he was drunk as a man could be. ¡°You do not tell me what to do, woman,¡± he screamed at Queen Cersei. ¡°I am king here, do you understand? I rule here, and if I say that I will fight tomorrow, I will fight!¡±
   Everyone was staring. Sansa saw Ser Barristan, and the king¡¯s brother Renly, and the short man who had talked to her so oddly and touched her hair, but no one made a move to interfere. The queen¡¯s face was a mask, so bloodless that it might have been sculpted from snow. She rose from the table, gathered her skirts around her, and stormed off in silence, servants trailing behind.
   Jaime Lannister put a hand on the king¡¯s shoulder, but the king shoved him away hard. Lannister stumbled and fell. The king guffawed. ¡°The great knight. I can still knock you in the dirt. Remember that, Kingslayer.¡± He slapped his chest with the jeweled goblet, splashing wine all over his satin tunic. ¡°Give me my hammer and not a man in the realm can stand before me!¡±
   Jaime Lannister rose and brushed himself off. ¡°As you say, Your Grace.¡± His voice was stiff.
   Lord Renly came forward, smiling. ¡°You¡¯ve spilled your wine, Robert. Let me bring you a fresh goblet.¡±
   Sansa started as Joffrey laid his hand on her arm. ¡°It grows late,¡± the prince said. He had a queer look on his face, as if he were not seeing her at all. ¡°Do you need an escort back to the castle?¡±
   ¡°No,¡± Sansa began. She looked for Septa Mordane, and was startled to find her with her head on the table, snoring soft and ladylike snores. ¡°I mean to say?.?.?.?yes, thank you, that would be most kind. I am tired, and the way is so dark. I should be glad for some protection.¡±
   Joffrey called out, ¡°Dog!¡±
   Sandor Clegane seemed to take form out of the night, so quickly did he appear. He had exchanged his armor for a red woolen tunic with a leather dog¡¯s head sewn on the front. The light of the torches made his burned face shine a dull red. ¡°Yes, Your Grace?¡± he said.
   ¡°Take my betrothed back to the castle, and see that no harm befalls her,¡± the prince told him brusquely. And without even a word of farewell, Joffrey strode off, leaving her there.
   Sansa could feel the Hound watching her. ¡°Did you think Joff was going to take you himself?¡± He laughed. He had a laugh like the snarling of dogs in a pit. ¡°Small chance of that.¡± He pulled her unresisting to her feet. ¡°Come, you¡¯re not the only one needs sleep. I¡¯ve drunk too much, and I may need to kill my brother tomorrow.¡± He laughed again.
   Suddenly terrified, Sansa pushed at Septa Mordane¡¯s shoulder, hoping to wake her, but she only snored the louder. King Robert had stumbled off and half the benches were suddenly empty. The feast was over, and the beautiful dream had ended with it.
   The Hound snatched up a torch to light their way. Sansa followed close beside him. The ground was rocky and uneven; the flickering light made it seem to shift and move beneath her. She kept her eyes lowered, watching where she placed her feet. They walked among the pavilions, each with its banner and its armor hung outside, the silence weighing heavier with every step. Sansa could not bear the sight of him, he frightened her so, yet she had been raised in all the ways of courtesy. A true lady would not notice his face, she told herself. ¡°You rode gallantly today, Ser Sandor,¡± she made herself say.
   Sandor Clegane snarled at her. ¡°Spare me your empty little compliments, girl?.?.?.?and your ser¡¯s. I am no knight. I spit on them and their vows. My brother is a knight. Did you see him ride today?¡±
   ¡°Yes,¡± Sansa whispered, trembling. ¡°He was?.?.?.?
   ¡°Gallant?¡± the Hound finished.
   He was mocking her, she realized. ¡°No one could withstand him,¡± she managed at last, proud of herself. It was no lie.
   Sandor Clegane stopped suddenly in the middle of a dark and empty field. She had no choice but to stop beside him. ¡°Some septa trained you well. You¡¯re like one of those birds from the Summer Isles, aren¡¯t you? A pretty little talking bird, repeating all the pretty little words they taught you to recite.¡±
   ¡°That¡¯s unkind.¡± Sansa could feel her heart fluttering in her chest. ¡°You¡¯re frightening me. I want to go now.¡±
   ¡°No one could withstand him,¡± the Hound rasped. ¡°That¡¯s truth enough. No one could ever withstand Gregor. That boy today, his second joust, oh, that was a pretty bit of business. You saw that, did you? Fool boy, he had no business riding in this company. No money, no squire, no one to help him with that armor. That gorget wasn¡¯t fastened proper. You think Gregor didn¡¯t notice that? You think Ser Gregor¡¯s lance rode up by chance, do you? Pretty little talking girl, you believe that, you¡¯re empty-headed as a bird for true. Gregor¡¯s lance goes where Gregor wants it to go. Look at me. Look at me!¡± Sandor Clegane put a huge hand under her chin and forced her face up. He squatted in front of her, and moved the torch close. ¡°There¡¯s a pretty for you. Take a good long stare. You know you want to. I¡¯ve watched you turning away all the way down the kingsroad. Piss on that. Take your look.¡±
   His fingers held her jaw as hard as an iron trap. His eyes watched hers. Drunken eyes, sullen with anger. She had to look.
   The right side of his face was gaunt, with sharp cheekbones and a grey eye beneath a heavy brow. His nose was large and hooked, his hair thin, dark. He wore it long and brushed it sideways, because no hair grew on the other side of that face.
   The left side of his face was a ruin. His ear had been burned away; there was nothing left but a hole. His eye was still good, but all around it was a twisted mass of scar, slick black flesh hard as leather, pocked with craters and fissured by deep cracks that gleamed red and wet when he moved. Down by his jaw, you could see a hint of bone where the flesh had been seared away.
   Sansa began to cry. He let go of her then, and snuffed out the torch in the dirt. ¡°No pretty words for that, girl? No little compliment the septa taught you?¡± When there was no answer, he continued. ¡°Most of them, they think it was some battle. A siege, a burning tower, an enemy with a torch. One fool asked if it was dragonsbreath.¡± His laugh was softer this time, but just as bitter. ¡°I¡¯ll tell you what it was, girl,¡± he said, a voice from the night, a shadow leaning so close now that she could smell the sour stench of wine on his breath. ¡°I was younger than you, six, maybe seven. A woodcarver set up shop in the village under my father¡¯s keep, and to buy favor he sent us gifts. The old man made marvelous toys. I don¡¯t remember what I got, but it was Gregor¡¯s gift I wanted. A wooden knight, all painted up, every joint pegged separate and fixed with strings, so you could make him fight. Gregor is five years older than me, the toy was nothing to him, he was already a squire, near six foot tall and muscled like an ox. So I took his knight, but there was no joy to it, I tell you. I was scared all the while, and true enough, he found me. There was a brazier in the room. Gregor never said a word, just picked me up under his arm and shoved the side of my face down in the burning coals and held me there while I screamed and screamed. You saw how strong he is. Even then, it took three grown men to drag him off me. The septons preach about the seven hells. What do they know? Only a man who¡¯s been burned knows what hell is truly like.
   ¡°My father told everyone my bedding had caught fire, and our maester gave me ointments. Ointments! Gregor got his ointments too. Four years later, they anointed him with the seven oils and he recited his knightly vows and Rhaegar Targaryen tapped him on the shoulder and said, ¡®Arise, Ser Gregor.¡¯ ¡±
   The rasping voice trailed off. He squatted silently before her, a hulking black shape shrouded in the night, hidden from her eyes. Sansa could hear his ragged breathing. She was sad for him, she realized. Somehow, the fear had gone away.
   The silence went on and on, so long that she began to grow afraid once more, but she was afraid for him now, not for herself. She found his massive shoulder with her hand. ¡°He was no true knight,¡± she whispered to him.
   The Hound threw back his head and roared. Sansa stumbled back, away from him, but he caught her arm. ¡°No,¡± he growled at her, ¡°no, little bird, he was no true knight.¡±
   The rest of the way into the city, Sandor Clegane said not a word. He led her to where the carts were waiting, told a driver to take them back to the Red Keep, and climbed in after her. They rode in silence through the King¡¯s Gate and up torchlit city streets. He opened the postern door and led her into the castle, his burned face twitching and his eyes brooding, and he was one step behind her as they climbed the tower stairs. He took her safe all the way to the corridor outside her bedchamber.
   ¡°Thank you, my lord,¡± Sansa said meekly.
   The Hound caught her by the arm and leaned close. ¡°The things I told you tonight,¡± he said, his voice sounding even rougher than usual. ¡°If you ever tell Joffrey?.?.?.?your sister, your father?.?.?.?any of them?.?.?.?¡±
   ¡°I won¡¯t,¡± Sansa whispered. ¡°I promise.¡±
   It was not enough. ¡°If you ever tell anyone,¡± he finished, ¡°I¡¯ll kill you.¡±
   
   30£®EDDARD
   I stood last vigil for him myself,¡± Ser Barristan Selmy said as they looked down at the body in the back of the cart. ¡°He had no one else. A mother in the Vale, I am told.¡±
   In the pale dawn light, the young knight looked as though he were sleeping. He had not been handsome, but death had smoothed his rough-hewn features and the silent sisters had dressed him in his best velvet tunic, with a high collar to cover the ruin the lance had made of his throat. Eddard Stark looked at his face, and wondered if it had been for his sake that the boy had died. Slain by a Lannister bannerman before Ned could speak to him; could that be mere happenstance? He supposed he would never know.
   ¡°Hugh was Jon Arryn¡¯s squire for four years,¡± Selmy went on. ¡°The king knighted him before he rode north, in Jon¡¯s memory. The lad wanted it desperately, yet I fear he was not ready.¡±
   Ned had slept badly last night and he felt tired beyond his years. ¡°None of us is ever ready,¡± he said.
   ¡°For knighthood?¡±
   ¡°For death.¡± Gently Ned covered the boy with his cloak, a bloodstained bit of blue bordered in crescent moons. When his mother asked why her son was dead, he reflected bitterly, they would tell her he had fought to honor the King¡¯s Hand, Eddard Stark. ¡°This was needless. War should not be a game.¡± Ned turned to the woman beside the cart, shrouded in grey, face hidden but for her eyes. The silent sisters prepared men for the grave, and it was ill fortune to look on the face of death. ¡°Send his armor home to the Vale. The mother will want to have it.¡±
   ¡°It is worth a fair piece of silver,¡± Ser Barristan said. ¡°The boy had it forged special for the tourney. Plain work, but good. I do not know if he had finished paying the smith.¡±
   ¡°He paid yesterday, my lord, and he paid dearly,¡± Ned replied. And to the silent sister he said, ¡°Send the mother the armor. I will deal with this smith.¡± She bowed her head.
   Afterward Ser Barristan walked with Ned to the king¡¯s pavilion. The camp was beginning to stir. Fat sausages sizzled and spit over firepits, spicing the air with the scents of garlic and pepper. Young squires hurried about on errands as their masters woke, yawning and stretching, to meet the day. A serving man with a goose under his arm bent his knee when he caught sight of them. ¡°M¡¯lords,¡± he muttered as the goose honked and pecked at his fingers. The shields displayed outside each tent heralded its occupant: the silver eagle of Seagard, Bryce Caron¡¯s field of nightingales, a cluster of grapes for the Redwynes, brindled boar, red ox, burning tree, white ram, triple spiral, purple unicorn, dancing maiden, blackadder, twin towers, horned owl, and last the pure white blazons of the Kingsguard, shining like the dawn.
   ¡°The king means to fight in the melee today,¡± Ser Barristan said as they were passing Ser Meryn¡¯s shield, its paint sullied by a deep gash where Loras Tyrell¡¯s lance had scarred the wood as he drove him from his saddle.
   ¡°Yes,¡± Ned said grimly. Jory had woken him last night to bring him that news. Small wonder he had slept so badly.
   Ser Barristan¡¯s look was troubled. ¡°They say night¡¯s beauties fade at dawn, and the children of wine are oft disowned in the morning light.¡±
   ¡°They say so,¡± Ned agreed, ¡°but not of Robert.¡± Other men might reconsider words spoken in drunken bravado, but Robert Baratheon would remember and, remembering, would never back down.
   The king¡¯s pavilion was close by the water, and the morning mists off the river had wreathed it in wisps of grey. It was all of golden silk, the largest and grandest structure in the camp. Outside the entrance, Robert¡¯s warhammer was displayed beside an immense iron shield blazoned with the crowned stag of House Baratheon.
   Ned had hoped to discover the king still abed in a wine-soaked sleep, but luck was not with him. They found Robert drinking beer from a polished horn and roaring his displeasure at two young squires who were trying to buckle him into his armor. ¡°Your Grace,¡± one was saying, almost in tears, ¡°it¡¯s made too small, it won¡¯t go.¡± He fumbled, and the gorget he was trying to fit around Robert¡¯s thick neck tumbled to the ground.
   ¡°Seven hells!¡± Robert swore. ¡°Do I have to do it myself? Piss on the both of you. Pick it up. Don¡¯t just stand there gaping, Lancel, pick it up!¡± The lad jumped, and the king noticed his company. ¡°Look at these oafs, Ned. My wife insisted I take these two to squire for me, and they¡¯re worse than useless. Can¡¯t even put a man¡¯s armor on him properly. Squires, they say. I say they¡¯re swineherds dressed up in silk.¡±
   Ned only needed a glance to understand the difficulty. ¡°The boys are not at fault,¡± he told the king. ¡°You¡¯re too fat for your armor, Robert.¡±
   Robert Baratheon took a long swallow of beer, tossed the empty horn onto his sleeping furs, wiped his mouth with the back of his hand, and said darkly, ¡°Fat? Fat, is it? Is that how you speak to your king?¡± He let go his laughter, sudden as a storm. ¡°Ah, damn you, Ned, why are you always right?¡±
   The squires smiled nervously until the king turned on them. ¡°You. Yes, both of you. You heard the Hand. The king is too fat for his armor. Go find Ser Aron Santagar. Tell him I need the breastplate stretcher. Now! What are you waiting for?¡±
   The boys tripped over each other in their haste to be quit of the tent. Robert managed to keep a stern face until they were gone. Then he dropped back into a chair, shaking with laughter.
   Ser Barristan Selmy chuckled with him. Even Eddard Stark managed a smile. Always, though, the graver thoughts crept in. He could not help taking note of the two squires: handsome boys, fair and well made. One was Sansa¡¯s age, with long golden curls; the other perhaps fifteen, sandy-haired, with a wisp of a mustache and the emerald-green eyes of the queen.
   ¡°Ah, I wish I could be there to see Santagar¡¯s face,¡± Robert said. ¡°I hope he¡¯ll have the wit to send them to someone else. We ought to keep them running all day!¡±
   ¡°Those boys,¡± Ned asked him. ¡°Lannisters?¡±
   Robert nodded, wiping tears from his eyes. ¡°Cousins. Sons of Lord Tywin¡¯s brother. One of the dead ones. Or perhaps the live one, now that I come to think on it. I don¡¯t recall. My wife comes from a very large family, Ned.¡±
   A very ambitious family, Ned thought. He had nothing against the squires, but it troubled him to see Robert surrounded by the queen¡¯s kin, waking and sleeping. The Lannister appetite for offices and honors seemed to know no bounds. ¡°The talk is you and the queen had angry words last night.¡±
   The mirth curdled on Robert¡¯s face. ¡°The woman tried to forbid me to fight in the melee. She¡¯s sulking in the castle now, damn her. Your sister would never have shamed me like that.¡±
   ¡°You never knew Lyanna as I did, Robert,¡± Ned told him. ¡°You saw her beauty, but not the iron underneath. She would have told you that you have no business in the melee.¡±
   ¡°You too?¡± The king frowned. ¡°You are a sour man, Stark. Too long in the north, all the juices have frozen inside you. Well, mine are still running.¡± He slapped his chest to prove it.
   ¡°You are the king,¡± Ned reminded him.
   ¡°I sit on the damn iron seat when I must. Does that mean I don¡¯t have the same hungers as other men? A bit of wine now and again, a girl squealing in bed, the feel of a horse between my legs? Seven hells, Ned, I want to hit someone.¡±
   Ser Barristan Selmy spoke up. ¡°Your Grace,¡± he said, ¡°it is not seemly that the king should ride into the melee. It would not be a fair contest. Who would dare strike you?¡±
   Robert seemed honestly taken aback. ¡°Why, all of them, damn it. If they can. And the last man left standing?.?.?.?¡±
   ¡°?.?.?.?will be you,¡± Ned finished. He saw at once that Selmy had hit the mark. The dangers of the melee were only a savor to Robert, but this touched on his pride. ¡°Ser Barristan is right. There¡¯s not a man in the Seven Kingdoms who would dare risk your displeasure by hurting you.¡±
   The king rose to his feet, his face flushed. ¡°Are you telling me those prancing cravens will let me win?¡±
   ¡°For a certainty,¡± Ned said, and Ser Barristan Selmy bowed his head in silent accord.
   For a moment Robert was so angry he could not speak. He strode across the tent, whirled, strode back, his face dark and angry. He snatched up his breastplate from the ground and threw it at Barristan Selmy in a wordless fury. Selmy dodged. ¡°Get out,¡± the king said then, coldly. ¡°Get out before I kill you.¡±
   Ser Barristan left quickly. Ned was about to follow when the king called out again. ¡°Not you, Ned.¡±
   Ned turned back. Robert took up his horn again, filled it with beer from a barrel in the corner, and thrust it at Ned. ¡°Drink,¡± he said brusquely.
   ¡°I¡¯ve no thirst...¡±
   ¡°Drink. Your king commands it.¡±
   Ned took the horn and drank. The beer was black and thick, so strong it stung the eyes.
   Robert sat down again. ¡°Damn you, Ned Stark. You and Jon Arryn, I loved you both. What have you done to me? You were the one should have been king, you or Jon.¡±
   ¡°You had the better claim, Your Grace.¡±
   ¡°I told you to drink, not to argue. You made me king, you could at least have the courtesy to listen when I talk, damn you. Look at me, Ned. Look at what kinging has done to me. Gods, too fat for my armor, how did it ever come to this?¡±
   ¡°Robert?.?.?.?¡±
   ¡°Drink and stay quiet, the king is talking. I swear to you, I was never so alive as when I was winning this throne, or so dead as now that I¡¯ve won it. And Cersei?.?.?.?I have Jon Arryn to thank for her. I had no wish to marry after Lyanna was taken from me, but Jon said the realm needed an heir. Cersei Lannister would be a good match, he told me, she would bind Lord Tywin to me should Viserys Targaryen ever try to win back his father¡¯s throne.¡± The king shook his head. ¡°I loved that old man, I swear it, but now I think he was a bigger fool than Moon Boy. Oh, Cersei is lovely to look at, truly, but cold?.?.?.?the way she guards her cunt, you¡¯d think she had all the gold of Casterly Rock between her legs. Here, give me that beer if you won¡¯t drink it.¡± He took the horn, upended it, belched, wiped his mouth. ¡°I am sorry for your girl, Ned. Truly. About the wolf, I mean. My son was lying, I¡¯d stake my soul on it. My son?.?.?.?you love your children, don¡¯t you?¡±
   ¡°With all my heart,¡± Ned said.
   ¡°Let me tell you a secret, Ned. More than once, I have dreamed of giving up the crown. Take ship for the Free Cities with my horse and my hammer, spend my time warring and whoring, that¡¯s what I was made for. The sellsword king, how the singers would love me. You know what stops me? The thought of Joffrey on the throne, with Cersei standing behind him whispering in his ear. My son. How could I have made a son like that, Ned?¡±
   ¡°He¡¯s only a boy,¡± Ned said awkwardly. He had small liking for Prince Joffrey, but he could hear the pain in Robert¡¯s voice. ¡°Have you forgotten how wild you were at his age?¡±
   ¡°It would not trouble me if the boy was wild, Ned. You don¡¯t know him as I do.¡± He sighed and shook his head. ¡°Ah, perhaps you are right. Jon despaired of me often enough, yet I grew into a good king.¡± Robert looked at Ned and scowled at his silence. ¡°You might speak up and agree now, you know.¡±
   ¡°Your Grace?.?.?.?¡± Ned began, carefully.
   Robert slapped Ned on the back. ¡°Ah, say that I¡¯m a better king than Aerys and be done with it. You never could lie for love nor honor, Ned Stark. I¡¯m still young, and now that you¡¯re here with me, things will be different. We¡¯ll make this a reign to sing of, and damn the Lannisters to seven hells. I smell bacon. Who do you think our champion will be today? Have you seen Mace Tyrell¡¯s boy? The Knight of Flowers, they call him. Now there¡¯s a son any man would be proud to own to. Last tourney, he dumped the Kingslayer on his golden rump, you ought to have seen the look on Cersei¡¯s face. I laughed till my sides hurt. Renly says he has this sister, a maid of fourteen, lovely as a dawn?.?.?.?¡±
   They broke their fast on black bread and boiled goose eggs and fish fried up with onions and bacon, at a trestle table by the river¡¯s edge. The king¡¯s melancholy melted away with the morning mist, and before long Robert was eating an orange and waxing fond about a morning at the Eyrie when they had been boys. ¡°?.?.?.?had given Jon a barrel of oranges, remember? Only the things had gone rotten, so I flung mine across the table and hit Dacks right in the nose. You remember, Redfort¡¯s pock-faced squire? He tossed one back at me, and before Jon could so much as fart, there were oranges flying across the High Hall in every direction.¡± He laughed uproariously, and even Ned smiled, remembering.
   This was the boy he had grown up with, he thought; this was the Robert Baratheon he¡¯d known and loved. If he could prove that the Lannisters were behind the attack on Bran, prove that they had murdered Jon Arryn, this man would listen. Then Cersei would fall, and the Kingslayer with her, and if Lord Tywin dared to rouse the west, Robert would smash him as he had smashed Rhaegar Targaryen on the Trident. He could see it all so clearly.
   That breakfast tasted better than anything Eddard Stark had eaten in a long time, and afterward his smiles came easier and more often, until it was time for the tournament to resume.
   Ned walked with the king to the jousting field. He had promised to watch the final tilts with Sansa; Septa Mordane was ill today, and his daughter was determined not to miss the end of the jousting. As he saw Robert to his place, he noted that Cersei Lannister had chosen not to appear; the place beside the king was empty. That too gave Ned cause to hope.
   He shouldered his way to where his daughter was seated and found her as the horns blew for the day¡¯s first joust. Sansa was so engrossed she scarcely seemed to notice his arrival.
   Sandor Clegane was the first rider to appear. He wore an olive- green cloak over his soot-grey armor. That, and his hound¡¯s-head helm, were his only concession to ornament.
   ¡°A hundred golden dragons on the Kingslayer,¡± Littlefinger announced loudly as Jaime Lannister entered the lists, riding an elegant blood bay destrier. The horse wore a blanket of gilded ringmail, and Jaime glittered from head to heel. Even his lance was fashioned from the golden wood of the Summer Isles.
   ¡°Done,¡± Lord Renly shouted back. ¡°The Hound has a hungry look about him this morning.¡±
   ¡°Even hungry dogs know better than to bite the hand that feeds them,¡± Littlefinger called dryly.
   Sandor Clegane dropped his visor with an audible clang and took up his position. Ser Jaime tossed a kiss to some woman in the commons, gently lowered his visor, and rode to the end of the lists. Both men couched their lances.
   Ned Stark would have loved nothing so well as to see them both lose, but Sansa was watching it all moist-eyed and eager. The hastily erected gallery trembled as the horses broke into a gallop. The Hound leaned forward as he rode, his lance rock steady, but Jaime shifted his seat deftly in the instant before impact. Clegane¡¯s point was turned harmlessly against the golden shield with the lion blazon, while his own hit square. Wood shattered, and the Hound reeled, fighting to keep his seat. Sansa gasped. A ragged cheer went up from the commons.
   ¡°I wonder how I ought spend your money,¡± Littlefinger called down to Lord Renly.
   The Hound just managed to stay in his saddle. He jerked his mount around hard and rode back to the lists for the second pass. Jaime Lannister tossed down his broken lance and snatched up a fresh one, jesting with his squire. The Hound spurred forward at a hard gallop. Lannister rode to meet him. This time, when Jaime shifted his seat, Sandor Clegane shifted with him. Both lances exploded, and by the time the splinters had settled, a riderless blood bay was trotting off in search of grass while Ser Jaime Lannister rolled in the dirt, golden and dented.
   Sansa said, ¡°I knew the Hound would win.¡±
   Littlefinger overheard. ¡°If you know who¡¯s going to win the second match, speak up now before Lord Renly plucks me clean,¡± he called to her. Ned smiled.
   ¡°A pity the Imp is not here with us,¡± Lord Renly said. ¡°I should have won twice as much.¡±
   Jaime Lannister was back on his feet, but his ornate lion helmet had been twisted around and dented in his fall, and now he could not get it off. The commons were hooting and pointing, the lords and ladies were trying to stifle their chuckles, and failing, and over it all Ned could hear King Robert laughing, louder than anyone. Finally they had to lead the Lion of Lannister off to a blacksmith, blind and stumbling.
   By then Ser Gregor Clegane was in position at the head of the lists. He was huge, the biggest man that Eddard Stark had ever seen. Robert Baratheon and his brothers were all big men, as was the Hound, and back at Winterfell there was a simpleminded stableboy named Hodor who dwarfed them all, but the knight they called the Mountain That Rides would have towered over Hodor. He was well over seven feet tall, closer to eight, with massive shoulders and arms thick as the trunks of small trees. His destrier seemed a pony in between his armored legs, and the lance he carried looked as small as a broom handle.
   Unlike his brother, Ser Gregor did not live at court. He was a solitary man who seldom left his own lands, but for wars and tourneys. He had been with Lord Tywin when King¡¯s Landing fell, a new-made knight of seventeen years, even then distinguished by his size and his implacable ferocity. Some said it had been Gregor who¡¯d dashed the skull of the infant prince Aegon Targaryen against a wall, and whispered that afterward he had raped the mother, the Dornish princess Elia, before putting her to the sword. These things were not said in Gregor¡¯s hearing.
   Ned Stark could not recall ever speaking to the man, though Gregor had ridden with them during Balon Greyjoy¡¯s rebellion, one knight among thousands. He watched him with disquiet. Ned seldom put much stock in gossip, but the things said of Ser Gregor were more than ominous. He was soon to be married for the third time, and one heard dark whisperings about the deaths of his first two wives. It was said that his keep was a grim place where servants disappeared unaccountably and even the dogs were afraid to enter the hall. And there had been a sister who had died young under queer circumstances, and the fire that had disfigured his brother, and the hunting accident that had killed their father. Gregor had inherited the keep, the gold, and the family estates. His younger brother Sandor had left the same day to take service with the Lannisters as a sworn sword, and it was said that he had never returned, not even to visit.
   When the Knight of Flowers made his entrance, a murmur ran through the crowd, and he heard Sansa¡¯s fervent whisper, ¡°Oh, he¡¯s so beautiful.¡± Ser Loras Tyrell was slender as a reed, dressed in a suit of fabulous silver armor polished to a blinding sheen and filigreed with twining black vines and tiny blue forget-me-nots. The commons realized in the same instant as Ned that the blue of the flowers came from sapphires; a gasp went up from a thousand throats. Across the boy¡¯s shoulders his cloak hung heavy. It was woven of forget-me-nots, real ones, hundreds of fresh blooms sewn to a heavy woolen cape.
   His courser was as slim as her rider, a beautiful grey mare, built for speed. Ser Gregor¡¯s huge stallion trumpeted as he caught her scent. The boy from Highgarden did something with his legs, and his horse pranced sideways, nimble as a dancer. Sansa clutched at his arm. ¡°Father, don¡¯t let Ser Gregor hurt him,¡± she said. Ned saw she was wearing the rose that Ser Loras had given her yesterday. Jory had told him about that as well.
   ¡°These are tourney lances,¡± he told his daughter. ¡°They make them to splinter on impact, so no one is hurt.¡± Yet he remembered the dead boy in the cart with his cloak of crescent moons, and the words were raw in his throat.
   Ser Gregor was having trouble controlling his horse. The stallion was screaming and pawing the ground, shaking his head. The Mountain kicked at the animal savagely with an armored boot. The horse reared and almost threw him.
   The Knight of Flowers saluted the king, rode to the far end of the list, and couched his lance, ready. Ser Gregor brought his animal to the line, fighting with the reins. And suddenly it began. The Mountain¡¯s stallion broke in a hard gallop, plunging forward wildly, while the mare charged as smooth as a flow of silk. Ser Gregor wrenched his shield into position, juggled with his lance, and all the while fought to hold his unruly mount on a straight line, and suddenly Loras Tyrell was on him, placing the point of his lance just there, and in an eye blink the Mountain was failing. He was so huge that he took his horse down with him in a tangle of steel and flesh.
   Ned heard applause, cheers, whistles, shocked gasps, excited muttering, and over it all the rasping, raucous laughter of the Hound. The Knight of Flowers reined up at the end of the lists. His lance was not even broken. His sapphires winked in the sun as he raised his visor, smiling. The commons went mad for him.
   In the middle of the field, Ser Gregor Clegane disentangled himself and came boiling to his feet. He wrenched off his helm and slammed it down onto the ground. His face was dark with fury and his hair fell down into his eyes. ¡°My sword,¡± he shouted to his squire, and the boy ran it out to him. By then his stallion was back on its feet as well.
   Gregor Clegane killed the horse with a single blow of such ferocity that it half severed the animal¡¯s neck. Cheers turned to shrieks in a heartbeat. The stallion went to its knees, screaming as it died. By then Gregor was striding down the lists toward Ser Loras Tyrell, his bloody sword clutched in his fist. ¡°Stop him!¡± Ned shouted, but his words were lost in the roar. Everyone else was yelling as well, and Sansa was crying.
   It all happened so fast. The Knight of Flowers was shouting for his own sword as Ser Gregor knocked his squire aside and made a grab for the reins of his horse. The mare scented blood and reared. Loras Tyrell kept his seat, but barely. Ser Gregor swung his sword, a savage two-handed blow that took the boy in the chest and knocked him from the saddle. The courser dashed away in panic as Ser Loras lay stunned in the dirt. But as Gregor lifted his sword for the killing blow, a rasping voice warned, ¡°Leave him be,¡± and a steel-clad hand wrenched him away from the boy.
   The Mountain pivoted in wordless fury, swinging his longsword in a killing arc with all his massive strength behind it, but the Hound caught the blow and turned it, and for what seemed an eternity the two brothers stood hammering at each other as a dazed Loras Tyrell was helped to safety. Thrice Ned saw Ser Gregor aim savage blows at the hound¡¯s-head helmet, yet not once did Sandor send a cut at his brother¡¯s unprotected face.
   It was the king¡¯s voice that put an end to it?.?.?.?the king¡¯s voice and twenty swords. Jon Arryn had told them that a commander needs a good battlefield voice, and Robert had proved the truth of that on the Trident. He used that voice now. ¡°STOP THIS MADNESS,¡± he boomed, ¡°IN THE NAME OF YOUR KING!¡±
   The Hound went to one knee. Ser Gregor¡¯s blow cut air, and at last he came to his senses. He dropped his sword and glared at Robert, surrounded by his Kingsguard and a dozen other knights and guardsmen. Wordlessly, he turned and strode off, shoving past Barristan Selmy. ¡°Let him go,¡± Robert said, and as quickly as that, it was over.
   ¡°Is the Hound the champion now?¡± Sansa asked Ned.
   ¡°No,¡± he told her. ¡°There will be one final joust, between the Hound and the Knight of Flowers.¡±
   But Sansa had the right of it after all. A few moments later Ser Loras Tyrell walked back onto the field in a simple linen doublet and said to Sandor Clegane, ¡°I owe you my life. The day is yours, ser.¡±
   ¡°I am no ser,¡± the Hound replied, but he took the victory, and the champion¡¯s purse, and, for perhaps the first time in his life, the love of the commons. They cheered him as he left the lists to return to his pavilion.
   As Ned walked with Sansa to the archery field, Littlefinger and Lord Renly and some of the others fell in with them. ¡°Tyrell had to know the mare was in heat,¡± Littlefinger was saying. ¡°I swear the boy planned the whole thing. Gregor has always favored huge, ill-tempered stallions with more spirit than sense.¡± The notion seemed to amuse him.
   It did not amuse Ser Barristan Selmy. ¡°There is small honor in tricks,¡± the old man said stiffly.
   ¡°Small honor and twenty thousand golds.¡± Lord Renly smiled.
   That afternoon a boy named Anguy, an unheralded commoner from the Dornish Marches, won the archery competition, outshooting Ser Balon Swann and Jalabhar Xho at a hundred paces after all the other bowmen had been eliminated at the shorter distances. Ned sent Alyn to seek him out and offer him a position with the Hand¡¯s guard, but the boy was flush with wine and victory and riches undreamed of, and he refused.
   The melee went on for three hours. Near forty men took part, freeriders and hedge knights and new-made squires in search of a reputation. They fought with blunted weapons in a chaos of mud and blood, small troops fighting together and then turning on each other as alliances formed and fractured, until only one man was left standing. The victor was the red priest, Thoros of Myr, a madman who shaved his head and fought with a flaming sword. He had won melees before; the fire sword frightened the mounts of the other riders, and nothing frightened Thoros. The final tally was three broken limbs, a shattered collarbone, a dozen smashed fingers, two horses that had to be put down, and more cuts, sprains, and bruises than anyone cared to count. Ned was desperately pleased that Robert had not taken part.
   That night at the feast, Eddard Stark was more hopeful than he had been in a great while. Robert was in high good humor, the Lannisters were nowhere to be seen, and even his daughters were behaving. Jory brought Arya down to join them, and Sansa spoke to her sister pleasantly. ¡°The tournament was magnificent,¡± she sighed. ¡°You should have come. How was your dancing?¡±
   ¡°I¡¯m sore all over,¡± Arya reported happily, proudly displaying a huge purple bruise on her leg.
   ¡°You must be a terrible dancer,¡± Sansa said doubtfully.
   Later, while Sansa was off listening to a troupe of singers perform the complex round of interwoven ballads called the ¡°Dance of the Dragons,¡± Ned inspected the bruise himself. ¡°I hope Forel is not being too hard on you,¡± he said.
   Arya stood on one leg. She was getting much better at that of late. ¡°Syrio says that every hurt is a lesson, and every lesson makes you better.¡±
   Ned frowned. The man Syrio Forel had come with an excellent reputation, and his flamboyant Braavosi style was well suited to Arya¡¯s slender blade, yet still?.?.?.?a few days ago, she had been wandering around with a swatch of black silk tied over her eyes. Syrio was teaching her to see with her ears and her nose and her skin, she told him. Before that, he had her doing spins and back flips. ¡°Arya, are you certain you want to persist in this?¡±
   She nodded. ¡°Tomorrow we¡¯re going to catch cats.¡±
   ¡°Cats.¡± Ned sighed. ¡°Perhaps it was a mistake to hire this Braavosi. If you like, I will ask Jory to take over your lessons. Or I might have a quiet word with Ser Barristan. He was the finest sword in the Seven Kingdoms in his youth.¡±
   ¡°I don¡¯t want them,¡± Arya said. ¡°I want Syrio.¡±
   Ned ran his fingers through his hair. Any decent master-at-arms could give Arya the rudiments of slash-and-parry without this nonsense of blindfolds, cartwheels, and hopping about on one leg, but he knew his youngest daughter well enough to know there was no arguing with that stubborn jut of jaw. ¡°As you wish,¡± he said. Surely she would grow tired of this soon. ¡°Try to be careful.¡±
   ¡°I will,¡± she promised solemnly as she hopped smoothly from her right leg to her left.
   Much later, after he had taken the girls back through the city and seen them both safe in bed, Sansa with her dreams and Arya with her bruises, Ned ascended to his own chambers atop the Tower of the Hand. The day had been warm and the room was close and stuffy. Ned went to the window and unfastened the heavy shutters to let in the cool night air. Across the Great Yard, he noticed the flickering glow of candlelight from Littlefinger¡¯s windows. The hour was well past midnight. Down by the river, the revels were only now beginning to dwindle and die.
   He took out the dagger and studied it. Littlefinger¡¯s blade, won by Tyrion Lannister in a tourney wager, sent to slay Bran in his sleep. Why? Why would the dwarf want Bran dead? Why would anyone want Bran dead?
   The dagger, Bran¡¯s fall, all of it was linked somehow to the murder of Jon Arryn, he could feel it in his gut, but the truth of Jon¡¯s death remained as clouded to him as when he had started. Lord Stannis had not returned to King¡¯s Landing for the tourney. Lysa Arryn held her silence behind the high walls of the Eyrie. The squire was dead, and Jory was still searching the whorehouses. What did he have but Robert¡¯s bastard?
   That the armorer¡¯s sullen apprentice was the king¡¯s son, Ned had no doubt. The Baratheon look was stamped on his face, in his jaw, his eyes, that black hair. Renly was too young to have fathered a boy of that age, Stannis too cold and proud in his honor. Gendry had to be Robert¡¯s.
   Yet knowing all that, what had he learned? The king had other baseborn children scattered throughout the Seven Kingdoms. He had openly acknowledged one of his bastards, a boy of Bran¡¯s age whose mother was highborn. The lad was being fostered by Lord Renly¡¯s castellan at Storm¡¯s End.
   Ned remembered Robert¡¯s first child as well, a daughter born in the Vale when Robert was scarcely more than a boy himself. A sweet little girl; the young lord of Storm¡¯s End had doted on her. He used to make daily visits to play with the babe, long after he had lost interest in the mother. Ned was often dragged along for company, whether he willed it or not. The girl would be seventeen or eighteen now, he realized; older than Robert had been when he fathered her. A strange thought.
   Cersei could not have been pleased by her lord husband¡¯s by-blows, yet in the end it mattered little whether the king had one bastard or a hundred. Law and custom gave the baseborn few rights. Gendry, the girl in the Vale, the boy at Storm¡¯s End, none of them could threaten Robert¡¯s trueborn children?.?.?.?
   His musings were ended by a soft rap on his door. ¡°A man to see you, my lord,¡± Harwin called. ¡°He will not give his name.¡±
   ¡°Send him in,¡± Ned said, wondering.
   The visitor was a stout man in cracked, mud-caked boots and a heavy brown robe of the coarsest roughspun, his features hidden by a cowl, his hands drawn up into voluminous sleeves.
   ¡°Who are you?¡± Ned asked.
   ¡°A friend,¡± the cowled man said in a strange, low voice. ¡°We must speak alone, Lord Stark.¡±
   Curiosity was stronger than caution. ¡°Harwin, leave us,¡± he commanded. Not until they were alone behind closed doors did his visitor draw back his cowl.
   ¡°Lord Varys?¡± Ned said in astonishment.
   ¡°Lord Stark,¡± Varys said politely, seating himself. ¡°I wonder if I might trouble you for a drink?¡±
   Ned filled two cups with summerwine and handed one to Varys. ¡°I might have passed within a foot of you and never recognized you,¡± he said, incredulous. He had never seen the eunuch dress in anything but silk and velvet and the richest damasks, and this man smelled of sweat instead of lilacs.
   ¡°That was my dearest hope,¡± Varys said. ¡°It would not do if certain people learned that we had spoken in private. The queen watches you closely. This wine is very choice. Thank you.¡±
   ¡°How did you get past my other guards?¡± Ned asked. Porther and Cayn had been posted outside the tower, and Alyn on the stairs.
   ¡°The Red Keep has ways known only to ghosts and spiders.¡± Varys smiled apologetically. ¡°I will not keep you long, my lord. There are things you must know. You are the King¡¯s Hand, and the king is a fool.¡± The eunuch¡¯s cloying tones were gone; now his voice was thin and sharp as a whip. ¡°Your friend, I know, yet a fool nonetheless ?.?.?.?and doomed, unless you save him. Today was a near thing. They had hoped to kill him during the melee.¡±
   For a moment Ned was speechless with shock. ¡°Who?¡±
   Varys sipped his wine. ¡°If I truly need to tell you that, you are a bigger fool than Robert and I am on the wrong side.¡±
   ¡°The Lannisters,¡± Ned said. ¡°The queen?.?.?.?no, I will not believe that, not even of Cersei. She asked him not to fight!¡±
   ¡°She forbade him to fight, in front of his brother, his knights, and half the court. Tell me truly, do you know any surer way to force King Robert into the melee? I ask you.¡±
   Ned had a sick feeling in his gut. The eunuch had hit upon a truth; tell Robert Baratheon he could not, should not, or must not do a thing, and it was as good as done. ¡°Even if he¡¯d fought, who would have dared to strike the king?¡±
   Varys shrugged. ¡°There were forty riders in the melee. The Lannisters have many friends. Amidst all that chaos, with horses screaming and bones breaking and Thoros of Myr waving that absurd firesword of his, who could name it murder if some chance blow felled His Grace?¡± He went to the flagon and refilled his cup. ¡°After the deed was done, the slayer would be beside himself with grief. I can almost hear him weeping. So sad. Yet no doubt the gracious and compassionate widow would take pity, lift the poor unfortunate to his feet, and bless him with a gentle kiss of forgiveness. Good King Joffrey would have no choice but to pardon him.¡± The eunuch stroked his cheek. ¡°Or perhaps Cersei would let Ser Ilyn strike off his head. Less risk for the Lannisters that way, though quite an unpleasant surprise for their little friend.¡±
   Ned felt his anger rise. ¡°You knew of this plot, and yet you did nothing.¡±
   ¡°I command whisperers, not warriors.¡±
   ¡°You might have come to me earlier.¡±
   ¡°Oh, yes, I confess it. And you would have rushed straight to the king, yes? And when Robert heard of his peril, what would he have done? I wonder.¡±
   Ned considered that. ¡°He would have damned them all, and fought anyway, to show he did not fear them.¡±
   Varys spread his hands. ¡°I will make another confession, Lord Eddard. I was curious to see what you would do. Why not come to me? you ask, and I must answer, Why, because I did not trust you, my lord.¡±
   ¡°You did not trust me?¡± Ned was frankly astonished.
   ¡°The Red Keep shelters two sorts of people, Lord Eddard,¡± Varys said. ¡°Those who are loyal to the realm, and those who are loyal only to themselves. Until this morning, I could not say which you might be?.?.?.?so I waited to see?.?.?.?and now I know, for a certainty.¡± He smiled a plump tight little smile, and for a moment his private face and public mask were one. ¡°I begin to comprehend why the queen fears you so much. Oh, yes I do.¡±
   ¡°You are the one she ought to fear,¡± Ned said.
   ¡°No. I am what I am. The king makes use of me, but it shames him. A most puissant warrior is our Robert, and such a manly man has little love for sneaks and spies and eunuchs. If a day should come when Cersei whispers, ¡®Kill that man,¡¯ Ilyn Payne will snick my head off in a twinkling, and who will mourn poor Varys then? North or south, they sing no songs for spiders.¡± He reached out and touched Ned with a soft hand. ¡°But you, Lord Stark?.?.?.?I think?.?.?.?no, I know?.?.?.?he would not kill you, not even for his queen, and there may lie our salvation.¡±
   It was all too much. For a moment Eddard Stark wanted nothing so much as to return to Winterfell, to the clean simplicity of the north, where the enemies were winter and the wildlings beyond the Wall. ¡°Surely Robert has other loyal friends,¡± he protested. ¡°His brothers, his...¡±
   ¡°...wife?¡± Varys finished, with a smile that cut. ¡°His brothers hate the Lannisters, true enough, but hating the queen and loving the king are not quite the same thing, are they? Ser Barristan loves his honor, Grand Maester Pycelle loves his office, and Littlefinger loves Littlefinger.¡±
   ¡°The Kingsguard...¡±
   ¡°A paper shield,¡± the eunuch said. ¡°Try not to look so shocked, Lord Stark. Jaime Lannister is himself a Sworn Brother of the White Swords, and we all know what his oath is worth. The days when men like Ryam Redwyne and Prince Aemon the Dragonknight wore the white cloak are gone to dust and song. Of these seven, only Ser Barristan Selmy is made of the true steel, and Selmy is old. Ser Boros and Ser Meryn are the queen¡¯s creatures to the bone, and I have deep suspicions of the others. No, my lord, when the swords come out in earnest, you will be the only true friend Robert Baratheon will have.¡±
   ¡°Robert must be told,¡± Ned said. ¡°If what you say is true, if even a part of it is true, the king must hear it for himself.¡±
   ¡°And what proof shall we lay before him? My words against theirs? My little birds against the queen and the Kingslayer, against his brothers and his council, against the Wardens of East and West, against all the might of Casterly Rock? Pray, send for Ser Ilyn directly, it will save us all some time. I know where that road ends.¡±
   ¡°Yet if what you say is true, they will only bide their time and make another attempt.¡±
   ¡°Indeed they will,¡± said Varys, ¡°and sooner rather than later, I do fear. You are making them most anxious, Lord Eddard. But my little birds will be listening, and together we may be able to forestall them, you and I.¡± He rose and pulled up his cowl so his face was hidden once more. ¡°Thank you for the wine. We will speak again. When you see me next at council, be certain to treat me with your accustomed contempt. You should not find it difficult.¡±
   He was at the door when Ned called, ¡°Varys.¡± The eunuch turned back. ¡°How did Jon Arryn die?¡±
   ¡°I wondered when you would get around to that.¡±
   ¡°Tell me.¡±
   ¡°The tears of Lys, they call it. A rare and costly thing, clear and sweet as water, and it leaves no trace. I begged Lord Arryn to use a taster, in this very room I begged him, but he would not hear of it. Only one who was less than a man would even think of such a thing, he told me.¡±
   Ned had to know the rest. ¡°Who gave him the poison?¡±
   ¡°Some dear sweet friend who often shared meat and mead with him, no doubt. Oh, but which one? There were many such. Lord Arryn was a kindly, trusting man.¡± The eunuch sighed. ¡°There was one boy. All he was, he owed Jon Arryn, but when the widow fled to the Eyrie with her household, he stayed in King¡¯s Landing and prospered. It always gladdens my heart to see the young rise in the world.¡± The whip was in his voice again, every word a stroke. ¡°He must have cut a gallant figure in the tourney, him in his bright new armor, with those crescent moons on his cloak. A pity he died so untimely, before you could talk to him?.?.?.?¡±
   Ned felt half-poisoned himself. ¡°The squire,¡± he said. ¡°Ser Hugh.¡± Wheels within wheels within wheels. Ned¡¯s head was pounding. ¡°Why? Why now? Jon Arryn had been Hand for fourteen years. What was he doing that they had to kill him?¡±
   ¡°Asking questions,¡± Varys said, slipping out the door.
   
   31£®TYRION
   As he stood in the predawn chill watching Chiggen butcher his horse, Tyrion Lannister chalked up one more debt owed the Starks. Steam rose from inside the carcass when the squat sellsword opened the belly with his skinning knife. His hands moved deftly, with never a wasted cut; the work had to be done quickly, before the stink of blood brought shadowcats down from the heights.
   ¡°None of us will go hungry tonight,¡± Bronn said. He was near a shadow himself; bone thin and bone hard, with black eyes and black hair and a stubble of beard.
   ¡°Some of us may,¡± Tyrion told him. ¡°I am not fond of eating horse. Particularly my horse.¡±
   ¡°Meat is meat,¡± Bronn said with a shrug. ¡°The Dothraki like horse more than beef or pork.¡±
   ¡°Do you take me for a Dothraki?¡± Tyrion asked sourly. The Dothraki ate horse, in truth; they also left deformed children out for the feral dogs who ran behind their khalasars. Dothraki customs had scant appeal for him.
   Chiggen sliced a thin strip of bloody meat off the carcass and held it up for inspection. ¡°Want a taste, dwarf?¡±
   ¡°My brother Jaime gave me that mare for my twenty-third name day,¡± Tyrion said in a flat voice.
   ¡°Thank him for us, then. If you ever see him again.¡± Chiggen grinned, showing yellow teeth, and swallowed the raw meat in two bites. ¡°Tastes well bred.¡±
   ¡°Better if you fry it up with onions,¡± Bronn put in.
   Wordlessly, Tyrion limped away. The cold had settled deep in his bones, and his legs were so sore he could scarcely walk. Perhaps his dead mare was the lucky one. He had hours more riding ahead of him, followed by a few mouthfuls of food and a short, cold sleep on hard ground, and then another night of the same, and another, and another, and the gods only knew how it would end. ¡°Damn her,¡± he muttered as he struggled up the road to rejoin his captors, remembering, ¡°damn her and all the Starks.¡±
   The memory was still bitter. One moment he¡¯d been ordering supper, and an eye blink later he was facing a room of armed men, with Jyck reaching for a sword and the fat innkeep shrieking, ¡°No swords, not here, please, m¡¯lords.¡±
   Tyrion wrenched down Jyck¡¯s arm hurriedly, before he got them both hacked to pieces. ¡°Where are your courtesies, Jyck? Our good hostess said no swords. Do as she asks.¡± He forced a smile that must have looked as queasy as it felt. ¡°You¡¯re making a sad mistake, Lady Stark. I had no part in any attack on your son. On my honor...¡±
   ¡°Lannister honor,¡± was all she said. She held up her hands for all the room to see. ¡°His dagger left these scars. The blade he sent to open my son¡¯s throat.¡±
   Tyrion felt the anger all around him, thick and smoky, fed by the deep cuts in the Stark woman¡¯s hands. ¡°Kill him,¡± hissed some drunken slattern from the back, and other voices took up the call, faster than he would have believed. Strangers all, friendly enough only a moment ago, and yet now they cried for his blood like hounds on a trail.
   Tyrion spoke up loudly, trying to keep the quaver from his voice. ¡°If Lady Stark believes I have some crime to answer for, I will go with her and answer for it.¡±
   It was the only possible course. Trying to cut their way out of this was a sure invitation to an early grave. A good dozen swords had responded to the Stark woman¡¯s plea for help: the Harrenhal man, the three Brackens, a pair of unsavory sellswords who looked as though they¡¯d kill him as soon as spit, and some fool field hands who doubtless had no idea what they were doing. Against that, what did Tyrion have? A dagger at his belt, and two men. Jyck swung a fair enough sword, but Morrec scarcely counted; he was part groom, part cook, part body servant, and no soldier. As for Yoren, whatever his feelings might have been, the black brothers were sworn to take no part in the quarrels of the realm. Yoren would do nothing.
   And indeed, the black brother stepped aside silently when the old knight by Catelyn Stark¡¯s side said, ¡°Take their weapons,¡± and the sellsword Bronn stepped forward to pull the sword from Jyck¡¯s fingers and relieve them all of their daggers. ¡°Good,¡± the old man said as the tension in the common room ebbed palpably, ¡°excellent.¡± Tyrion recognized the gruff voice; Winterfell¡¯s master-at-arms, shorn of his whiskers.
   Scarlet-tinged spittle flew from the fat innkeep¡¯s mouth as she begged of Catelyn Stark, ¡°Don¡¯t kill him here!¡±
   ¡°Don¡¯t kill him anywhere,¡± Tyrion urged.
   ¡°Take him somewheres else, no blood here, m¡¯lady, I wants no high lordlin¡¯s quarrels.¡±
   ¡°We are taking him back to Winterfell,¡± she said, and Tyrion thought, Well, perhaps?.?.?.?By then he¡¯d had a moment to glance over the room and get a better idea of the situation. He was not altogether displeased by what he saw. Oh, the Stark woman had been clever, no doubt of it. Force them to make a public affirmation of the oaths sworn her father by the lords they served, and then call on them for succor, and her a woman, yes, that was sweet. Yet her success was not as complete as she might have liked. There were close to fifty in the common room by his rough count. Catelyn Stark¡¯s plea had roused a bare dozen; the others looked confused, or frightened, or sullen. Only two of the Freys had stirred, Tyrion noted, and they¡¯d sat back down quick enough when their captain failed to move. He might have smiled if he¡¯d dared.
   ¡°Winterfell it is, then,¡± he said instead. That was a long ride, as he could well attest, having just ridden it the other way. So many things could happen along the way. ¡°My father will wonder what has become of me,¡± he added, catching the eye of the swordsman who¡¯d offered to yield up his room. ¡°He¡¯ll pay a handsome reward to any man who brings him word of what happened here today.¡± Lord Tywin would do no such thing, of course, but Tyrion would make up for it if he won free.
   Ser Rodrik glanced at his lady, his look worried, as well it might be. ¡°His men come with him,¡± the old knight announced. ¡°And we¡¯ll thank the rest of you to stay quiet about what you¡¯ve seen here.¡±
   It was all Tyrion could do not to laugh. Quiet? The old fool. Unless he took the whole inn, the word would begin to spread the instant they were gone. The freerider with the gold coin in his pocket would fly to Casterly Rock like an arrow. If not him, then someone else. Yoren would carry the story south. That fool singer might make a lay of it. The Freys would report back to their lord, and the gods only knew what he might do. Lord Walder Frey might be sworn to Riverrun, but he was a cautious man who had lived a long time by making certain he was always on the winning side. At the very least he would send his birds winging south to King¡¯s Landing, and he might well dare more than that.
   Catelyn Stark wasted no time. ¡°We must ride at once. We¡¯ll want fresh mounts, and provisions for the road. You men, know that you have the eternal gratitude of House Stark. If any of you choose to help us guard our captives and get them safe to Winterfell, I promise you shall be well rewarded.¡± That was all it took; the fools came rushing forward. Tyrion studied their faces; they would indeed be well rewarded, he vowed to himself, but perhaps not quite as they imagined.
   Yet even as they were bundling him outside, saddling the horses in the rain, and tying his hands with a length of coarse rope, Tyrion Lannister was not truly afraid. They would never get him to Winterfell, he would have given odds on that. Riders would be after them within the day, birds would take wing, and surely one of the river lords would want to curry favor with his father enough to take a hand. Tyrion was congratulating himself on his subtlety when someone pulled a hood down over his eyes and lifted him up onto a saddle.
   They set out through the rain at a hard gallop, and before long Tyrion¡¯s thighs were cramped and aching and his butt throbbed with pain. Even when they were safely away from the inn, and Catelyn Stark slowed them to a trot, it was a miserable pounding journey over rough ground, made worse by his blindness. Every twist and turn put him in danger of falling off his horse. The hood muffled sound, so he could not make out what was being said around him, and the rain soaked through the cloth and made it cling to his face, until even breathing was a struggle. The rope chafed his wrists raw and seemed to grow tighter as the night wore on. I was about to settle down to a warm fire and a roast fowl, and that wretched singer had to open his mouth, he thought mournfully. The wretched singer had come along with them. ¡°There is a great song to be made from this, and I¡¯m the one to make it,¡± he told Catelyn Stark when he announced his intention of riding with them to see how the ¡°splendid adventure¡± turned out. Tyrion wondered whether the boy would think the adventure quite so splendid once the Lannister riders caught up with them.
   The rain had finally stopped and dawn light was seeping through the wet cloth over his eyes when Catelyn Stark gave the command to dismount. Rough hands pulled him down from his horse, untied his wrists, and yanked the hood off his head. When he saw the narrow stony road, the foothills rising high and wild all around them, and the jagged snowcapped peaks on the distant horizon, all the hope went out of him in a rush. ¡°This is the high road,¡± he gasped, looking at Lady Stark with accusation. ¡°The eastern road. You said we were riding for Winterfell!¡±
   Catelyn Stark favored him with the faintest of smiles. ¡°Often and loudly,¡± she agreed. ¡°No doubt your friends will ride that way when they come after us. I wish them good speed.¡±
   Even now, long days later, the memory filled him with a bitter rage. All his life Tyrion had prided himself on his cunning, the only gift the gods had seen fit to give him, and yet this seven-times-damned she-wolf Catelyn Stark had outwitted him at every turn. The knowledge was more galling than the bare fact of his abduction.
   They stopped only as long as it took to feed and water the horses, and then they were off again. This time Tyrion was spared the hood. After the second night they no longer bound his hands, and once they had gained the heights they scarcely bothered to guard him at all. It seemed they did not fear his escape. And why should they? Up here the land was harsh and wild, and the high road little more than a stony track. If he did run, how far could he hope to go, alone and without provisions? The shadowcats would make a morsel of him, and the clans that dwelt in the mountain fastnesses were brigands and murderers who bowed to no law but the sword.
   Yet still the Stark woman drove them forward relentlessly. He knew where they were bound. He had known it since the moment they pulled off his hood. These mountains were the domain of House Arryn, and the late Hand¡¯s widow was a Tully, Catelyn Stark¡¯s sister?.?.?.?and no friend to the Lannisters. Tyrion had known the Lady Lysa slightly during her years at King¡¯s Landing, and did not look forward to renewing the acquaintance.
   His captors were clustered around a stream a short ways down the high road. The horses had drunk their fill of the icy cold water, and were grazing on clumps of brown grass that grew from clefts in the rock. Jyck and Morrec huddled close, sullen and miserable. Mohor stood over them, leaning on his spear and wearing a rounded iron cap that made him look as if he had a bowl on his head. Nearby, Marillion the singer sat oiling his woodharp, complaining of what the damp was doing to his strings.
   ¡°We must have some rest, my lady,¡± the hedge knight Ser Willis Wode was saying to Catelyn Stark as Tyrion approached. He was Lady Whent¡¯s man, stiff-necked and stolid, and the first to rise to aid Catelyn Stark back at the inn.
   ¡°Ser Willis speaks truly, my lady,¡± Ser Rodrik said. ¡°This is the third horse we have lost...¡±
   ¡°We will lose more than horses if we¡¯re overtaken by the Lannisters,¡± she reminded them. Her face was windburnt and gaunt, but it had lost none of its determination.
   ¡°Small chance of that here,¡± Tyrion put in.
   ¡°The lady did not ask your views, dwarf,¡± snapped Kurleket, a great fat oaf with short-cropped hair and a pig¡¯s face. He was one of the Brackens, a man-at-arms in the service of Lord Jonos. Tyrion had made a special effort to learn all their names, so he might thank them later for their tender treatment of him. A Lannister always paid his debts. Kurleket would learn that someday, as would his friends Lharys and Mohor, and the good Ser Willis, and the sellswords Bronn and Chiggen. He planned an especially sharp lesson for Marillion, him of the woodharp and the sweet tenor voice, who was struggling so manfully to rhyme imp with gimp and limp so he could make a song of this outrage.
   ¡°Let him speak,¡± Lady Stark commanded.
   Tyrion Lannister seated himself on a rock. ¡°By now our pursuit is likely racing across the Neck, chasing your lie up the kingsroad?.?.?.?assuming there is a pursuit, which is by no means certain. Oh, no doubt the word has reached my father?.?.?.?but my father does not love me overmuch, and I am not at all sure that he will bother to bestir himself.¡± It was only half a lie; Lord Tywin Lannister cared not a fig for his deformed son, but he tolerated no slights on the honor of his House. ¡°This is a cruel land, Lady Stark. You¡¯ll find no succor until you reach the Vale, and each mount you lose burdens the others all the more. Worse, you risk losing me. I am small, and not strong, and if I die, then what¡¯s the point?¡± That was no lie at all; Tyrion did not know how much longer he could endure this pace.
   ¡°It might be said that your death is the point, Lannister,¡± Catelyn Stark replied.
   ¡°I think not,¡± Tyrion said. ¡°If you wanted me dead, you had only to say the word, and one of these staunch friends of yours would gladly have given me a red smile.¡± He looked at Kurleket, but the man was too dim to taste the mockery.
   ¡°The Starks do not murder men in their beds.¡±
   ¡°Nor do I,¡± he said. ¡°I tell you again, I had no part in the attempt to kill your son.¡±
   ¡°The assassin was armed with your dagger.¡±
   Tyrion felt the heat rise in him. ¡°It was not my dagger,¡± he insisted. ¡°How many times must I swear to that? Lady Stark, whatever you may believe of me, I am not a stupid man. Only a fool would arm a common footpad with his own blade.¡±
   Just for a moment, he thought he saw a flicker of doubt in her eyes, but what she said was, ¡°Why would Petyr lie to me?¡±
   ¡°Why does a bear shit in the woods?¡± he demanded. ¡°Because it is his nature. Lying comes as easily as breathing to a man like Littlefinger. You ought to know that, you of all people.¡±
   She took a step toward him, her face tight. ¡°And what does that mean, Lannister?¡±
   Tyrion cocked his head. ¡°Why, every man at court has heard him tell how he took your maidenhead, my lady.¡±
   ¡°That is a lie!¡± Catelyn Stark said.
   ¡°Oh, wicked little imp,¡± Marillion said, shocked.
   Kurleket drew his dirk, a vicious piece of black iron. ¡°At your word, m¡¯lady, I¡¯ll toss his lying tongue at your feet.¡± His pig eyes were wet with excitement at the prospect.
   Catelyn Stark stared at Tyrion with a coldness on her face such as he had never seen. ¡°Petyr Baelish loved me once. He was only a boy. His passion was a tragedy for all of us, but it was real, and pure, and nothing to be made mock of. He wanted my hand. That is the truth of the matter. You are truly an evil man, Lannister.¡±
   ¡°And you are truly a fool, Lady Stark. Littlefinger has never loved anyone but Littlefinger, and I promise you that it is not your hand that he boasts of, it¡¯s those ripe breasts of yours, and that sweet mouth, and the heat between your legs.¡±
   Kurleket grabbed a handful of hair and yanked his head back in a hard jerk, baring his throat. Tyrion felt the cold kiss of steel beneath his chin. ¡°Shall I bleed him, my lady?¡±
   ¡°Kill me and the truth dies with me,¡± Tyrion gasped.
   ¡°Let him talk,¡± Catelyn Stark commanded.
   Kurleket let go of Tyrion¡¯s hair, reluctantly.
   Tyrion took a deep breath. ¡°How did Littlefinger tell you I came by this dagger of his? Answer me that.¡±
   ¡°You won it from him in a wager, during the tourney on Prince Joffrey¡¯s name day.¡±
   ¡°When my brother Jaime was unhorsed by the Knight of Flowers, that was his story, no?¡±
   ¡°It was,¡± she admitted. A line creased her brow.
   ¡°Riders!¡±
   The shriek came from the wind-carved ridge above them. Ser Rodrik had sent Lharys scrambling up the rock face to watch the road while they took their rest.
   For a long second, no one moved. Catelyn Stark was the first to react. ¡°Ser Rodrik, Ser Willis, to horse,¡± she shouted. ¡°Get the other mounts behind us. Mohor, guard the prisoners...¡±
   ¡°Arm us!¡± Tyrion sprang to his feet and seized her by the arm. ¡°You will need every sword.¡±
   She knew he was right, Tyrion could see it. The mountain clans cared nothing for the enmities of the great houses; they would slaughter Stark and Lannister with equal fervor, as they slaughtered each other. They might spare Catelyn herself; she was still young enough to bear sons. Still, she hesitated.
   ¡°I hear them!¡± Ser Rodrik called out. Tyrion turned his head to listen, and there it was: hoofbeats, a dozen horses or more, coming nearer. Suddenly everyone was moving, reaching for weapons, running to their mounts.
   Pebbles rained down around them as Lharys came springing and sliding down the ridge. He landed breathless in front of Catelyn Stark, an ungainly-looking man with wild tufts of rust-colored hair sticking out from under a conical steel cap. ¡°Twenty men, maybe twenty-five,¡± he said, breathless. ¡°Milk Snakes or Moon Brothers, by my guess. They must have eyes out, m¡¯lady?.?.?.?hidden watchers?.?.?.?they know we¡¯re here.¡±
   Ser Rodrik Cassel was already ahorse, a longsword in hand. Mohor crouched behind a boulder, both hands on his iron-tipped spear, a dagger between his teeth. ¡°You, singer,¡± Ser Willis Wode called out. ¡°Help me with this breastplate.¡± Marillion sat frozen, clutching his woodharp, his face as pale as milk, but Tyrion¡¯s man Morrec bounded quickly to his feet and moved to help the knight with his armor.
   Tyrion kept his grip on Catelyn Stark. ¡°You have no choice,¡± he told her. ¡°Three of us, and a fourth man wasted guarding us?.?.?.?four men can be the difference between life and death up here.¡±
   ¡°Give me your word that you will put down your swords again after the fight is done.¡±
   ¡°My word?¡± The hoofbeats were louder now. Tyrion grinned crookedly. ¡°Oh, that you have, my lady?.?.?.?on my honor as a Lannister.¡±
   For a moment he thought she would spit at him, but instead she snapped, ¡°Arm them,¡± and as quick as that she was pulling away. Ser Rodrik tossed Jyck his sword and scabbard, and wheeled to meet the foe. Morrec helped himself to a bow and quiver, and went to one knee beside the road. He was a better archer than swordsman. And Bronn rode up to offer Tyrion a double-bladed axe.
   ¡°I have never fought with an axe.¡± The weapon felt awkward and unfamiliar in his hands. It had a short haft, a heavy head, a nasty spike on top.
   ¡°Pretend you¡¯re splitting logs,¡± Bronn said, drawing his longsword from the scabbard across his back. He spat, and trotted off to form up beside Chiggen and Ser Rodrik. Ser Willis mounted up to join them, fumbling with his helmet, a metal pot with a thin slit for his eyes and a long black silk plume.
   ¡°Logs don¡¯t bleed,¡± Tyrion said to no one in particular. He felt naked without armor. He looked around for a rock and ran over to where Marillion was hiding. ¡°Move over.¡±
   ¡°Go away!¡± the boy screamed back at him. ¡°I¡¯m a singer, I want no part of this fight!¡±
   ¡°What, lost your taste for adventure?¡± Tyrion kicked at the youth until he slid over, and not a moment too soon. A heartbeat later, the riders were on them.
   There were no heralds, no banners, no horns nor drums, only the twang of bowstrings as Morrec and Lharys let fly, and suddenly the clansmen came thundering out of the dawn, lean dark men in boiled leather and mismatched armor, faces hidden behind barred halfhelms. In gloved hands were clutched all manner of weapons: longswords and lances and sharpened scythes, spiked clubs and daggers and heavy iron mauls. At their head rode a big man in a striped shadowskin cloak, armed with a two-handed greatsword.
   Ser Rodrik shouted ¡°Winterfell!¡± and rode to meet him, with Bronn and Chiggen beside him, screaming some wordless battle cry. Ser Willis Wode followed, swinging a spiked morningstar around his head. ¡°Harrenhal! Harrenhal!¡± he sang. Tyrion felt a sudden urge to leap up, brandish his axe, and boom out, ¡°Casterly Rock!¡± but the insanity passed quickly and he crouched down lower.
   He heard the screams of frightened horses and the crash of metal on metal. Chiggen¡¯s sword raked across the naked face of a mailed rider, and Bronn plunged through the clansmen like a whirlwind, cutting down foes right and left. Ser Rodrik hammered at the big man in the shadowskin cloak, their horses dancing round each other as they traded blow for blow. Jyck vaulted onto a horse and galloped bareback into the fray. Tyrion saw an arrow sprout from the throat of the man in the shadowskin cloak. When he opened his mouth to scream, only blood came out. By the time he fell, Ser Rodrik was fighting someone else.
   Suddenly Marillion shrieked, covering his head with his woodharp as a horse leapt over their rock. Tyrion scrambled to his feet as the rider turned to come back at them, hefting a spiked maul. Tyrion swung his axe with both hands. The blade caught the charging horse in the throat with a meaty thunk, angling upward, and Tyrion almost lost his grip as the animal screamed and collapsed. He managed to wrench the axe free and lurch clumsily out of the way. Marillion was less fortunate. Horse and rider crashed to the ground in a tangle on top of the singer. Tyrion danced back in while the brigand¡¯s leg was still pinned beneath his fallen mount, and buried the axe in the man¡¯s neck, just above the shoulder blades.
   As he struggled to yank the blade loose, he heard Marillion moaning under the bodies. ¡°Someone help me,¡± the singer gasped. ¡°Gods have mercy, I¡¯m bleeding.¡±
   ¡°I believe that¡¯s horse blood,¡± Tyrion said. The singer¡¯s hand came crawling out from beneath the dead animal, scrabbling in the dirt like a spider with five legs. Tyrion put his heel on the grasping fingers and felt a satisfying crunch. ¡°Close your eyes and pretend you¡¯re dead,¡± he advised the singer before he hefted the axe and turned away.
   After that, things ran together. The dawn was full of shouts and screams and heavy with the scent of blood, and the world had turned to chaos. Arrows hissed past his ear and clattered off the rocks. He saw Bronn unhorsed, fighting with a sword in each hand. Tyrion kept on the fringes of the fight, sliding from rock to rock and darting out of the shadows to hew at the legs of passing horses. He found a wounded clansman and left him dead, helping himself to the man¡¯s halfhelm. It fit too snugly, but Tyrion was glad of any protection at all. Jyck was cut down from behind while he sliced at a man in front of him, and later Tyrion stumbled over Kurleket¡¯s body. The pig face had been smashed in with a mace, but Tyrion recognized the dirk as he plucked it from the man¡¯s dead fingers. He was sliding it through his belt when he heard a woman¡¯s scream.
   Catelyn Stark was trapped against the stone face of the mountain with three men around her, one still mounted and the other two on foot. She had a dagger clutched awkwardly in her maimed hands, but her back was to the rock now and they had penned her on three sides. Let them have the bitch, Tyrion thought, and welcome to her, yet somehow he was moving. He caught the first man in the back of the knee before they even knew he was there, and the heavy axehead split flesh and bone like rotten wood. Logs that bleed, Tyrion thought inanely as the second man came for him. Tyrion ducked under his sword, lashed out with the axe, the man reeled backward?.?.?.?and Catelyn Stark stepped up behind him and opened his throat. The horseman remembered an urgent engagement elsewhere and galloped off suddenly.
   Tyrion looked around. The enemy were all vanquished or vanished. Somehow the fighting had ended when he wasn¡¯t looking. Dying horses and wounded men lay all around, screaming or moaning. To his vast astonishment, he was not one of them. He opened his fingers and let the axe thunk to the ground. His hands were sticky with blood. He could have sworn they had been fighting for half a day, but the sun seemed scarcely to have moved at all.
   ¡°Your first battle?¡± Bronn asked later as he bent over Jyck¡¯s body, pulling off his boots. They were good boots, as befit one of Lord Tywin¡¯s men; heavy leather, oiled and supple, much finer than what Bronn was wearing.
   Tyrion nodded. ¡°My father will be so proud,¡± he said. His legs were cramping so badly he could scarcely stand. Odd, he had never once noticed the pain during the battle.
   ¡°You need a woman now,¡± Bronn said with a glint in his black eyes. He shoved the boots into his saddlebag. ¡°Nothing like a woman after a man¡¯s been blooded, take my word.¡±
   Chiggen stopped looting the corpses of the brigands long enough to snort and lick his lips.
   Tyrion glanced over to where Lady Stark was dressing Ser Rodrik¡¯s wounds. ¡°I¡¯m willing if she is,¡± he said. The freeriders broke into laughter, and Tyrion grinned and thought, There¡¯s a start.
   Afterward he knelt by the stream and washed the blood off his face in water cold as ice. As he limped back to the others, he glanced again at the slain. The dead clansmen were thin, ragged men, their horses scrawny and undersized, with every rib showing. What weapons Bronn and Chiggen had left them were none too impressive. Mauls, clubs, a scythe?.?.?.?He remembered the big man in the shadowskin cloak who had dueled Ser Rodrik with a two-handed greatsword, but when he found his corpse sprawled on the stony ground, the man was not so big after all, the cloak was gone, and Tyrion saw that the blade was badly notched, its cheap steel spotted with rust. Small wonder the clansmen had left nine bodies on the ground.
   They had only three dead; two of Lord Bracken¡¯s men-at-arms, Kurleket and Mohor, and his own man Jyck, who had made such a bold show with his bareback charge. A fool to the end, Tyrion thought.
   ¡°Lady Stark, I urge you to press on, with all haste,¡± Ser Willis Wode said, his eyes scanning the ridgetops warily through the slit in his helm. ¡°We drove them off for the moment, but they will not have gone far.¡±
   ¡°We must bury our dead, Ser Willis,¡± she said. ¡°These were brave men. I will not leave them to the crows and shadowcats.¡±
   ¡°This soil is too stony for digging,¡± Ser Willis said.
   ¡°Then we shall gather stones for cairns.¡±
   ¡°Gather all the stones you want,¡± Bronn told her, ¡°but do it without me or Chiggen. I¡¯ve better things to do than pile rocks on dead men?.?.?.?breathing, for one.¡± He looked over the rest of the survivors. ¡°Any of you who hope to be alive come nightfall, ride with us.¡±
   ¡°My lady, I fear he speaks the truth,¡± Ser Rodrik said wearily. The old knight had been wounded in the fight, a deep gash in his left arm and a spear thrust that grazed his neck, and he sounded his age. ¡°If we linger here, they will be on us again for a certainty, and we may not live through a second attack.¡±
   Tyrion could see the anger in Catelyn¡¯s face, but she had no choice. ¡°May the gods forgive us, then. We will ride at once.¡±
   There was no shortage of horses now. Tyrion moved his saddle to Jyck¡¯s spotted gelding, who looked strong enough to last another three or four days at least. He was about to mount when Lharys stepped up and said, ¡°I¡¯ll take that dirk now, dwarf.¡±
   ¡°Let him keep it.¡± Catelyn Stark looked down from her horse. ¡°And see that he has his axe back as well. We may have need of it if we are attacked again.¡±
   ¡°You have my thanks, lady,¡± Tyrion said, mounting up.
   ¡°Save them,¡± she said curtly. ¡°I trust you no more than I did before.¡± She was gone before he could frame a reply.
   Tyrion adjusted his stolen helm and took the axe from Bronn. He remembered how he had begun the journey, with his wrists bound and a hood pulled down over his head, and decided that this was a definite improvement. Lady Stark could keep her trust; so long as he could keep the axe, he would count himself ahead in the game.
   Ser Willis Wode led them out. Bronn took the rear, with Lady Stark safely in the middle, Ser Rodrik a shadow beside her. Marillion kept throwing sullen looks back at Tyrion as they rode. The singer had broken several ribs, his woodharp, and all four fingers on his playing hand, yet the day had not been an utter loss to him; somewhere he had acquired a magnificent shadowskin cloak, thick black fur slashed by stripes of white. He huddled beneath its folds silently, and for once had nothing to say.
   They heard the deep growls of shadowcats behind them before they had gone half a mile, and later the wild snarling of the beasts fighting over the corpses they had left behind. Marillion grew visibly pale. Tyrion trotted up beside him. ¡°Craven,¡± he said, ¡°rhymes nicely with raven.¡± He kicked his horse and moved past the singer, up to Ser Rodrik and Catelyn Stark.
   She looked at him, lips pressed tightly together.
   ¡°As I was saying before we were so rudely interrupted,¡± Tyrion began, ¡°there is a serious flaw in Littlefinger¡¯s fable. Whatever you may believe of me, Lady Stark, I promise you this, I never bet against my family.¡±
   
   32£®ARYA
   The one-eared black tom arched his back and hissed at her.
   Arya padded down the alley, balanced lightly on the balls of her bare feet, listening to the flutter of her heart, breathing slow deep breaths. Quiet as a shadow, she told herself, light as a feather. The tomcat watched her come, his eyes wary.
   Catching cats was hard. Her hands were covered with half-healed scratches, and both knees were scabbed over where she had scraped them raw in tumbles. At first even the cook¡¯s huge fat kitchen cat had been able to elude her, but Syrio had kept her at it day and night. When she¡¯d run to him with her hands bleeding, he had said, ¡°So slow? Be quicker, girl. Your enemies will give you more than scratches.¡± He had dabbed her wounds with Myrish fire, which burned so bad she had had to bite her lip to keep from screaming. Then he sent her out after more cats.
   The Red Keep was full of cats: lazy old cats dozing in the sun, cold-eyed mousers twitching their tails, quick little kittens with claws like needles, ladies¡¯ cats all combed and trusting, ragged shadows prowling the midden heaps. One by one Arya had chased them down and snatched them up and brought them proudly to Syrio Forel?.?.?.?all but this one, this one-eared black devil of a tomcat. ¡°That¡¯s the real king of this castle right there,¡± one of the gold cloaks had told her. ¡°Older than sin and twice as mean. One time, the king was feasting the queen¡¯s father, and that black bastard hopped up on the table and snatched a roast quail right out of Lord Tywin¡¯s fingers. Robert laughed so hard he like to burst. You stay away from that one, child.¡±
   He had run her halfway across the castle; twice around the Tower of the Hand, across the inner bailey, through the stables, down the serpentine steps, past the small kitchen and the pig yard and the barracks of the gold cloaks, along the base of the river wall and up more steps and back and forth over Traitor¡¯s Walk, and then down again and through a gate and around a well and in and out of strange buildings until Arya didn¡¯t know where she was.
   Now at last she had him. High walls pressed close on either side, and ahead was a blank windowless mass of stone. Quiet as a shadow, she repeated, sliding forward, light as a feather.
   When she was three steps away from him, the tomcat bolted. Left, then right, he went; and right, then left, went Arya, cutting off his escape. He hissed again and tried to dart between her legs. Quick as a snake, she thought. Her hands closed around him. She hugged him to her chest, whirling and laughing aloud as his claws raked at the front of her leather jerkin. Ever so fast, she kissed him right between the eyes, and jerked her head back an instant before his claws would have found her face. The tomcat yowled and spit.
   ¡°What¡¯s he doing to that cat?¡±
   Startled, Arya dropped the cat and whirled toward the voice. The tom bounded off in the blink of an eye. At the end of the alley stood a girl with a mass of golden curls, dressed as pretty as a doll in blue satin. Beside her was a plump little blond boy with a prancing stag sewn in pearls across the front of his doublet and a miniature sword at his belt. Princess Myrcella and Prince Tommen, Arya thought. A septa as large as a draft horse hovered over them, and behind her two big men in crimson cloaks, Lannister house guards.
   ¡°What were you doing to that cat, boy?¡± Myrcella asked again, sternly. To her brother she said, ¡°He¡¯s a ragged boy, isn¡¯t he? Look at him.¡± She giggled.
   ¡°A ragged dirty smelly boy,¡± Tommen agreed.
   They don¡¯t know me, Arya realized. They don¡¯t even know I¡¯m a girl. Small wonder; she was barefoot and dirty, her hair tangled from the long run through the castle, clad in a jerkin ripped by cat claws and brown roughspun pants hacked off above her scabby knees. You don¡¯t wear skirts and silks when you¡¯re catching cats. Quickly she lowered her head and dropped to one knee. Maybe they wouldn¡¯t recognize her. If they did, she would never hear the end of it. Septa Mordane would be mortified, and Sansa would never speak to her again from the shame.
   The old fat septa moved forward. ¡°Boy, how did you come here? You have no business in this part of the castle.¡±
   ¡°You can¡¯t keep this sort out,¡± one of the red cloaks said. ¡°Like trying to keep out rats.¡±
   ¡°Who do you belong to, boy?¡± the septa demanded. ¡°Answer me. What¡¯s wrong with you, are you mute?¡±
   Arya¡¯s voice caught in her throat. If she answered, Tommen and Myrcella would know her for certain.
   ¡°Godwyn, bring him here,¡± the septa said. The taller of the guardsmen started down the alley.
   Panic gripped her throat like a giant¡¯s hand. Arya could not have spoken if her life had hung on it. Calm as still water, she mouthed silently.
   As Godwyn reached for her, Arya moved. Quick as a snake. She leaned to her left, letting his fingers brush her arm, spinning around him. Smooth as summer silk. By the time he got himself turned, she was sprinting down the alley. Swift as a deer. The septa was screeching at her. Arya slid between legs as thick and white as marble columns, bounded to her feet, bowled into Prince Tommen and hopped over him when he sat down hard and said ¡°Oof,¡± spun away from the second guard, and then she was past them all, running full out.
   She heard shouts, then pounding footsteps, closing behind her. She dropped and rolled. The red cloak went careening past her, stumbling. Arya sprang back to her feet. She saw a window above her, high and narrow, scarcely more than an arrow slit. Arya leapt, caught the sill, pulled herself up. She held her breath as she wriggled through. Slippery as an eel. Dropping to the floor in front of a startled scrubwoman, she hopped up, brushed the rushes off her clothes, and was off again, out the door and along a long hall, down a stair, across a hidden courtyard, around a corner and over a wall and through a low narrow window into a pitch-dark cellar. The sounds grew more and more distant behind her.
   Arya was out of breath and quite thoroughly lost. She was in for it now if they had recognized her, but she didn¡¯t think they had. She¡¯d moved too fast. Swift as a deer.
   She hunkered down in the dark against a damp stone wall and listened for the pursuit, but the only sound was the beating of her own heart and a distant drip of water. Quiet as a shadow, she told herself. She wondered where she was. When they had first come to King¡¯s Landing, she used to have bad dreams about getting lost in the castle. Father said the Red Keep was smaller than Winterfell, but in her dreams it had been immense, an endless stone maze with walls that seemed to shift and change behind her. She would find herself wandering down gloomy halls past faded tapestries, descending endless circular stairs, darting through courtyards or over bridges, her shouts echoing unanswered. In some of the rooms the red stone walls would seem to drip blood, and nowhere could she find a window. Sometimes she would hear her father¡¯s voice, but always from a long way off, and no matter how hard she ran after it, it would grow fainter and fainter, until it faded to nothing and Arya was alone in the dark.
   It was very dark right now, she realized. She hugged her bare knees tight against her chest and shivered. She would wait quietly and count to ten thousand. By then it would be safe for her to come creeping back out and find her way home.
   By the time she had reached eighty-seven, the room had begun to lighten as her eyes adjusted to the blackness. Slowly the shapes around her took on form. Huge empty eyes stared at her hungrily through the gloom, and dimly she saw the jagged shadows of long teeth. She had lost the count. She closed her eyes and bit her lip and sent the fear away. When she looked again, the monsters would be gone. Would never have been. She pretended that Syrio was beside her in the dark, whispering in her ear. Calm as still water, she told herself. Strong as a bear. Fierce as a wolverine. She opened her eyes again.
   The monsters were still there, but the fear was gone.
   Arya got to her feet, moving warily. The heads were all around her. She touched one, curious, wondering if it was real. Her fingertips brushed a massive jaw. It felt real enough. The bone was smooth beneath her hand, cold and hard to the touch. She ran her fingers down a tooth, black and sharp, a dagger made of darkness. It made her shiver.
   ¡°It¡¯s dead,¡± she said aloud. ¡°It¡¯s just a skull, it can¡¯t hurt me.¡± Yet somehow the monster seemed to know she was there. She could feel its empty eyes watching her through the gloom, and there was something in that dim, cavernous room that did not love her. She edged away from the skull and backed into a second, larger than the first. For an instant she could feel its teeth digging into her shoulder, as if it wanted a bite of her flesh. Arya whirled, felt leather catch and tear as a huge fang nipped at her jerkin, and then she was running. Another skull loomed ahead, the biggest monster of all, but Arya did not even slow. She leapt over a ridge of black teeth as tall as swords, dashed through hungry jaws, and threw herself against the door.
   Her hands found a heavy iron ring set in the wood, and she yanked at it. The door resisted a moment, before it slowly began to swing inward, with a creak so loud Arya was certain it could be heard all through the city. She opened the door just far enough to slip through, into the hallway beyond.
   If the room with the monsters had been dark, the hall was the blackest pit in the seven hells. Calm as still water, Arya told herself, but even when she gave her eyes a moment to adjust, there was nothing to see but the vague grey outline of the door she had come through. She wiggled her fingers in front of her face, felt the air move, saw nothing. She was blind. A water dancer sees with all her senses, she reminded herself. She closed her eyes and steadied her breathing one two three, drank in the quiet, reached out with her hands.
   Her fingers brushed against rough unfinished stone to her left. She followed the wall, her hand skimming along the surface, taking small gliding steps through the darkness. All halls lead somewhere. Where there is a way in, there is a way out. Fear cuts deeper than swords. Arya would not be afraid. It seemed as if she had been walking a long ways when the wall ended abruptly and a draft of cold air blew past her cheek. Loose hairs stirred faintly against her skin.
   From somewhere far below her, she heard noises. The scrape of boots, the distant sound of voices. A flickering light brushed the wall ever so faintly, and she saw that she stood at the top of a great black well, a shaft twenty feet across plunging deep into the earth. Huge stones had been set into the curving walls as steps, circling down and down, dark as the steps to hell that Old Nan used to tell them of. And something was coming up out of the darkness, out of the bowels of the earth?.?.?.?
   Arya peered over the edge and felt the cold black breath on her face. Far below, she saw the light of a single torch, small as the flame of a candle. Two men, she made out. Their shadows writhed against the sides of the well, tall as giants. She could hear their voices, echoing up the shaft.
   ¡°?.?.?.?found one bastard,¡± one said. ¡°The rest will come soon. A day, two days, a fortnight?.?.?.?¡±
   ¡°And when he learns the truth, what will he do?¡± a second voice asked in the liquid accents of the Free Cities.
   ¡°The gods alone know,¡± the first voice said. Arya could see a wisp of grey smoke drifting up off the torch, writhing like a snake as it rose. ¡°The fools tried to kill his son, and what¡¯s worse, they made a mummer¡¯s farce of it. He¡¯s not a man to put that aside. I warn you, the wolf and lion will soon be at each other¡¯s throats, whether we will it or no.¡±
   ¡°Too soon, too soon,¡± the voice with the accent complained. ¡°What good is war now? We are not ready. Delay.¡±
   ¡°As well bid me stop time. Do you take me for a wizard?¡±
   The other chuckled. ¡°No less.¡± Flames licked at the cold air. The tall shadows were almost on top of her. An instant later the man holding the torch climbed into her sight, his companion beside him. Arya crept back away from the well, dropped to her stomach, and flattened herself against the wall. She held her breath as the men reached the top of the steps.
   ¡°What would you have me do?¡± asked the torchbearer, a stout man in a leather half cape. Even in heavy boots, his feet seemed to glide soundlessly over the ground. A round scarred face and a stubble of dark beard showed under his steel cap, and he wore mail over boiled leather, and a dirk and shortsword at his belt. It seemed to Arya there was something oddly familiar about him.
   ¡°If one Hand can die, why not a second?¡± replied the man with the accent and the forked yellow beard. ¡°You have danced the dance before, my friend.¡± He was no one Arya had ever seen before, she was certain of it. Grossly fat, yet he seemed to walk lightly, carrying his weight on the balls of his feet as a water dancer might. His rings glimmered in the torchlight, red-gold and pale silver, crusted with rubies, sapphires, slitted yellow tiger eyes. Every finger wore a ring; some had two.
   ¡°Before is not now, and this Hand is not the other,¡± the scarred man said as they stepped out into the hall. Still as stone, Arya told herself, quiet as a shadow. Blinded by the blaze of their own torch, they did not see her pressed flat against the stone, only a few feet away.
   ¡°Perhaps so,¡± the forked beard replied, pausing to catch his breath after the long climb. ¡°Nonetheless, we must have time. The princess is with child. The khal will not bestir himself until his son is born. You know how they are, these savages.¡±
   The man with the torch pushed at something. Arya heard a deep rumbling. A huge slab of rock, red in the torchlight, slid down out of the ceiling with a resounding crash that almost made her cry out. Where the entry to the well had been was nothing but stone, solid and unbroken.
   ¡°If he does not bestir himself soon, it may be too late,¡± the stout man in the steel cap said. ¡°This is no longer a game for two players, if ever it was. Stannis Baratheon and Lysa Arryn have fled beyond my reach, and the whispers say they are gathering swords around them. The Knight of Flowers writes Highgarden, urging his lord father to send his sister to court. The girl is a maid of fourteen, sweet and beautiful and tractable, and Lord Renly and Ser Loras intend that Robert should bed her, wed her, and make a new queen. Littlefinger?.?.?.?the gods only know what game Littlefinger is playing. Yet Lord Stark¡¯s the one who troubles my sleep. He has the bastard, he has the book, and soon enough he¡¯ll have the truth. And now his wife has abducted Tyrion Lannister, thanks to Littlefinger¡¯s meddling. Lord Tywin will take that for an outrage, and Jaime has a queer affection for the Imp. If the Lannisters move north, that will bring the Tullys in as well. Delay, you say. Make haste, I reply. Even the finest of jugglers cannot keep a hundred balls in the air forever.¡±
   ¡°You are more than a juggler, old friend. You are a true sorcerer. All I ask is that you work your magic awhile longer.¡± They started down the hall in the direction Arya had come, past the room with the monsters.
   ¡°What I can do, I will,¡± the one with the torch said softly. ¡°I must have gold, and another fifty birds.¡±
   She let them get a long way ahead, then went creeping after them. Quiet as a shadow.
   ¡°So many?¡± The voices were fainter as the light dwindled ahead of her. ¡°The ones you need are hard to find?.?.?.?so young, to know their letters?.?.?.?perhaps older?.?.?.?not die so easy?.?.?.?¡±
   ¡°No. The younger are safer?.?.?.?treat them gently?.?.?.?¡±
   ¡°?.?.?.?.if they kept their tongues?.?.?.?¡±
   ¡°?.?.?.?the risk?.?.?.?¡±
   Long after their voices had faded away, Arya could still see the light of the torch, a smoking star that bid her follow. Twice it seemed to disappear, but she kept on straight, and both times she found herself at the top of steep, narrow stairs, the torch glimmering far below her. She hurried after it, down and down. Once she stumbled over a rock and fell against the wall, and her hand found raw earth supported by timbers, whereas before the tunnel had been dressed stone.
   She must have crept after them for miles. Finally they were gone, but there was no place to go but forward. She found the wall again and followed, blind and lost, pretending that Nymeria was padding along beside her in the darkness. At the end she was knee-deep in foul-smelling water, wishing she could dance upon it as Syrio might have, and wondering if she¡¯d ever see light again. It was full dark when finally Arya emerged into the night air.
   She found herself standing at the mouth of a sewer where it emptied into the river. She stank so badly that she stripped right there, dropping her soiled clothing on the riverbank as she dove into the deep black waters. She swam until she felt clean, and crawled out shivering. Some riders went past along the river road as Arya was washing her clothes, but if they saw the scrawny naked girl scrubbing her rags in the moonlight, they took no notice.
   She was miles from the castle, but from anywhere in King¡¯s Landing you needed only to look up to see the Red Keep high on Aegon¡¯s Hill, so there was no danger of losing her way. Her clothes were almost dry by the time she reached the gatehouse. The portcullis was down and the gates barred, so she turned aside to a postern door. The gold cloaks who had the watch sneered when she told them to let her in. ¡°Off with you,¡± one said. ¡°The kitchen scraps are gone, and we¡¯ll have no begging after dark.¡±
   ¡°I¡¯m not a beggar,¡± she said. ¡°I live here.¡±
   ¡°I said, off with you. Do you need a clout on the ear to help your hearing?¡±
   ¡°I want to see my father.¡±
   The guards exchanged a glance. ¡°I want to fuck the queen myself, for all the good it does me,¡± the younger one said.
   The older scowled. ¡°Who¡¯s this father of yours, boy, the city ratcatcher?¡±
   ¡°The Hand of the King,¡± Arya told him.
   Both men laughed, but then the older one swung his fist at her, casually, as a man would swat a dog. Arya saw the blow coming even before it began. She danced back out of the way, untouched. ¡°I¡¯m not a boy,¡± she spat at them. ¡°I¡¯m Arya Stark of Winterfell, and if you lay a hand on me my lord father will have both your heads on spikes. If you don¡¯t believe me, fetch Jory Cassel or Vayon Poole from the Tower of the Hand.¡± She put her hands on her hips. ¡°Now are you going to open the gate, or do you need a clout on the ear to help your hearing?¡±
   Her father was alone in the solar when Harwin and Fat Tom marched her in, an oil lamp glowing softly at his elbow. He was bent over the biggest book Arya had ever seen, a great thick tome with cracked yellow pages of crabbed script, bound between faded leather covers, but he closed it to listen to Harwin¡¯s report. His face was stern as he sent the men away with thanks.
   ¡°You realize I had half my guard out searching for you?¡± Eddard Stark said when they were alone. ¡°Septa Mordane is beside herself with fear. She¡¯s in the sept praying for your safe return. Arya, you know you are never to go beyond the castle gates without my leave.¡±
   ¡°I didn¡¯t go out the gates,¡± she blurted. ¡°Well, I didn¡¯t mean to. I was down in the dungeons, only they turned into this tunnel. It was all dark, and I didn¡¯t have a torch or a candle to see by, so I had to follow. I couldn¡¯t go back the way I came on account of the monsters. Father, they were talking about killing you! Not the monsters, the two men. They didn¡¯t see me, I was being still as stone and quiet as a shadow, but I heard them. They said you had a book and a bastard and if one Hand could die, why not a second? Is that the book? Jon¡¯s the bastard, I bet.¡±
   ¡°Jon? Arya, what are you talking about? Who said this?¡±
   ¡°They did,¡± she told him. ¡°There was a fat one with rings and a forked yellow beard, and another in mail and a steel cap, and the fat one said they had to delay but the other one told him he couldn¡¯t keep juggling and the wolf and the lion were going to eat each other and it was a mummer¡¯s farce.¡± She tried to remember the rest. She hadn¡¯t quite understood everything she¡¯d heard, and now it was all mixed up in her head. ¡°The fat one said the princess was with child. The one in the steel cap, he had the torch, he said that they had to hurry. I think he was a wizard.¡±
   ¡°A wizard,¡± said Ned, unsmiling. ¡°Did he have a long white beard and tall pointed hat speckled with stars?¡±
   ¡°No! It wasn¡¯t like Old Nan¡¯s stories. He didn¡¯t look like a wizard, but the fat one said he was.¡±
   ¡°I warn you, Arya, if you¡¯re spinning this thread of air...¡±
   ¡°No, I told you, it was in the dungeons, by the place with the secret wall. I was chasing cats, and well?.?.?.?¡± She screwed up her face. If she admitted knocking over Prince Tommen, he would be really angry with her. ¡°?.?.?.?well, I went in this window. That¡¯s where I found the monsters.¡±
   ¡°Monsters and wizards,¡± her father said. ¡°It would seem you¡¯ve had quite an adventure. These men you heard, you say they spoke of juggling and mummery?¡±
   ¡°Yes,¡± Arya admitted, ¡°only...¡±
   ¡°Arya, they were mummers,¡± her father told her. ¡°There must be a dozen troupes in King¡¯s Landing right now, come to make some coin off the tourney crowds. I¡¯m not certain what these two were doing in the castle, but perhaps the king has asked for a show.¡±
   ¡°No.¡± She shook her head stubbornly. ¡°They weren¡¯t...¡±
   ¡°You shouldn¡¯t be following people about and spying on them in any case. Nor do I cherish the notion of my daughter climbing in strange windows after stray cats. Look at you, sweetling. Your arms are covered with scratches. This has gone on long enough. Tell Syrio Forel that I want a word with hirn...¡±
   He was interrupted by a short, sudden knock. ¡°Lord Eddard, pardons,¡± Desmond called out, opening the door a crack, ¡°but there¡¯s a black brother here begging audience. He says the matter is urgent. I thought you would want to know.¡±
   ¡°My door is always open to the Night¡¯s Watch,¡± Father said.
   Desmond ushered the man inside. He was stooped and ugly, with an unkempt beard and unwashed clothes, yet Father greeted him pleasantly and asked his name.
   ¡°Yoren, as it please m¡¯lord. My pardons for the hour.¡± He bowed to Arya. ¡°And this must be your son. He has your look.¡±
   ¡°I¡¯m a girl,¡± Arya said, exasperated. If the old man was down from the Wall, he must have come by way of Winterfell. ¡°Do you know my brothers?¡± she asked excitedly. ¡°Robb and Bran are at Winterfell, and Jon¡¯s on the Wall. Jon Snow, he¡¯s in the Night¡¯s Watch too, you must know him, he has a direwolf, a white one with red eyes. Is Jon a ranger yet? I¡¯m Arya Stark.¡± The old man in his smelly black clothes was looking at her oddly, but Arya could not seem to stop talking. ¡°When you ride back to the Wall, would you bring Jon a letter if I wrote one?¡± She wished Jon were here right now. He¡¯d believe her about the dungeons and the fat man with the forked beard and the wizard in the steel cap.
   ¡°My daughter often forgets her courtesies,¡± Eddard Stark said with a faint smile that softened his words. ¡°I beg your forgiveness, Yoren. Did my brother Benjen send you?¡±
   ¡°No one sent me, m¡¯lord, saving old Mormont. I¡¯m here to find men for the Wall, and when Robert next holds court, I¡¯ll bend the knee and cry our need, see if the king and his Hand have some scum in the dungeons they¡¯d be well rid of. You might say as Benjen Stark is why we¡¯re talking, though. His blood ran black. Made him my brother as much as yours. It¡¯s for his sake I¡¯m come. Rode hard, I did, near killed my horse the way I drove her, but I left the others well behind.¡±
   ¡°The others?¡±
   Yoren spat. ¡°Sellswords and freeriders and like trash. That inn was full o¡¯ them, and I saw them take the scent. The scent of blood or the scent of gold, they smell the same in the end. Not all o¡¯ them made for King¡¯s Landing, either. Some went galloping for Casterly Rock, and the Rock lies closer. Lord Tywin will have gotten the word by now, you can count on it.¡±
   Father frowned. ¡°What word is this?¡±
   Yoren eyed Arya. ¡°One best spoken in private, m¡¯lord, begging your pardons.¡±
   ¡°As you say. Desmond, see my daughter to her chambers.¡± He kissed her on the brow. ¡°We¡¯ll finish our talk on the morrow.¡±
   Arya stood rooted to the spot. ¡°Nothing bad¡¯s happened to Jon, has it?¡± she asked Yoren. ¡°Or Uncle Benjen?¡±
   ¡°Well, as to Stark, I can¡¯t say. The Snow boy was well enough when I left the Wall. It¡¯s not them as concerns me.¡±
   Desmond took her hand. ¡°Come along, milady. You heard your lord father.¡±
   Arya had no choice but to go with him, wishing it had been Fat Tom. With Tom, she might have been able to linger at the door on some excuse and hear what Yoren was saying, but Desmond was too single-minded to trick. ¡°How many guards does my father have?¡± she asked him as they descended to her bedchamber.
   ¡°Here at King¡¯s Landing? Fifty.¡±
   ¡°You wouldn¡¯t let anyone kill him, would you?¡± she asked.
   Desmond laughed. ¡°No fear on that count, little lady. Lord Eddard¡¯s guarded night and day. He¡¯ll come to no harm.¡±
   ¡°The Lannisters have more than fifty men,¡± Arya pointed out.
   ¡°So they do, but every northerner is worth ten of these southron swords, so you can sleep easy.¡±
   ¡°What if a wizard was sent to kill him?¡±
   ¡°Well, as to that,¡± Desmond replied, drawing his longsword, ¡°wizards die the same as other men, once you cut their heads off.¡±
   
   33£®EDDARD
   Robert, I beg of you,¡± Ned pleaded, ¡°hear what you are saying. You are talking of murdering a child.¡±
   ¡°The whore is pregnant!¡± The king¡¯s fist slammed down on the council table loud as a thunderclap. ¡°I warned you this would happen, Ned. Back in the barrowlands, I warned you, but you did not care to hear it. Well, you¡¯ll hear it now. I want them dead, mother and child both, and that fool Viserys as well. Is that plain enough for you? I want them dead.¡±
   The other councillors were all doing their best to pretend that they were somewhere else. No doubt they were wiser than he was. Eddard Stark had seldom felt quite so alone. ¡°You will dishonor yourself forever if you do this.¡±
   ¡°Then let it be on my head, so long as it is done. I am not so blind that I cannot see the shadow of the axe when it is hanging over my own neck.¡±
   ¡°There is no axe,¡± Ned told his king. ¡°Only the shadow of a shadow, twenty years removed?.?.?.?if it exists at all.¡±
   ¡°If?¡± Varys asked softly, wringing powdered hands together. ¡°My lord, you wrong me. Would I bring ties to king and council?¡±
   Ned looked at the eunuch coldly. ¡°You would bring us the whisperings of a traitor half a world away, my lord. Perhaps Mormont is wrong. Perhaps he is lying.¡±
   ¡°Ser Jorah would not dare deceive me,¡± Varys said with a sly smile. ¡°Rely on it, my lord. The princess is with child.¡±
   ¡°So you say. If you are wrong, we need not fear. If the girl miscarries, we need not fear. If she births a daughter in place of a son, we need not fear. If the babe dies in infancy, we need not fear.¡±
   ¡°But if it is a boy?¡± Robert insisted. ¡°If he lives?¡±
   ¡°The narrow sea would still lie between us. I shall fear the Dothraki the day they teach their horses to run on water.¡±
   The king took a swallow of wine and glowered at Ned across the council table. ¡°So you would counsel me to do nothing until the dragonspawn has landed his army on my shores, is that it?¡±
   ¡°This ¡®dragonspawn¡¯ is in his mother¡¯s belly,¡± Ned said. ¡°Even Aegon did no conquering until after he was weaned.¡±
   ¡°Gods! You are stubborn as an aurochs, Stark.¡± The king looked around the council table. ¡°Have the rest of you mislaid your tongues? Will no one talk sense to this frozen-faced fool?¡±
   Varys gave the king an unctuous smile and laid a soft hand on Ned¡¯s sleeve. ¡°I understand your qualms, Lord Eddard, truly I do. It gave me no joy to bring this grievous news to council. It is a terrible thing we contemplate, a vile thing. Yet we who presume to rule must do vile things for the good of the realm, howevermuch it pains us.¡±
   Lord Renly shrugged. ¡°The matter seems simple enough to me. We ought to have had Viserys and his sister killed years ago, but His Grace my brother made the mistake of listening to Jon Arryn.¡±
   ¡°Mercy is never a mistake, Lord Renly,¡± Ned replied. ¡°On the Trident, Ser Barristan here cut down a dozen good men, Robert¡¯s friends and mine. When they brought him to us, grievously wounded and near death, Roose Bolton urged us to cut his throat, but your brother said, ¡®I will not kill a man for loyalty, nor for fighting well,¡¯ and sent his own maester to tend Ser Barristan¡¯s wounds.¡± He gave the king a long cool look. ¡°Would that man were here today.¡±
   Robert had shame enough to blush. ¡°It was not the same,¡± he complained. ¡°Ser Barristan was a knight of the Kingsguard.¡±
   ¡°Whereas Daenerys is a fourteen-year-old girl.¡± Ned knew he was pushing this well past the point of wisdom, yet he could not keep silent. ¡°Robert, I ask you, what did we rise against Aerys Targaryen for, if not to put an end to the murder of children?¡±
   ¡°To put an end to Targaryens!¡± the king growled.
   ¡°Your Grace, I never knew you to fear Rhaegar.¡± Ned fought to keep the scorn out of his voice, and failed. ¡°Have the years so unmanned you that you tremble at the shadow of an unborn child?¡±
   Robert purpled. ¡°No more, Ned,¡± he warned, pointing. ¡°Not another word. Have you forgotten who is king here?¡±
   ¡°No, Your Grace,¡± Ned replied. ¡°Have you?¡±
   ¡°Enough!¡± the king bellowed. ¡°I am sick of talk. I¡¯ll be done with this, or be damned. What say you all?¡±
   ¡°She must be killed,¡± Lord Renly declared.
   ¡°We have no choice,¡± murmured Varys. ¡°Sadly, sadly?.?.?.?¡±
   Ser Barristan Selmy raised his pale blue eyes from the table and said, ¡°Your Grace, there is honor in facing an enemy on the battlefield, but none in killing him in his mother¡¯s womb. Forgive me, but I must stand with Lord Eddard.¡±
   Grand Maester Pycelle cleared his throat, a process that seemed to take some minutes. ¡°My order serves the realm, not the ruler. Once I counseled King Aerys as loyally as I counsel King Robert now, so I bear this girl child of his no ill will. Yet I ask you this, should war come again, how many soldiers will die? How many towns will burn? How many children will be ripped from their mothers to perish on the end of a spear?¡± He stroked his luxuriant white beard, infinitely sad, infinitely weary. ¡°Is it not wiser, even kinder, that Daenerys Targaryen should die now so that tens of thousands might live?¡±
   ¡°Kinder,¡± Varys said. ¡°Oh, well and truly spoken, Grand Maester. It is so true. Should the gods in their caprice grant Daenerys Targaryen a son, the realm must bleed.¡±
   Littlefinger was the last. As Ned looked to him, Lord Petyr stifled a yawn. ¡°When you find yourself in bed with an ugly woman, the best thing to do is close your eyes and get on with it,¡± he declared. ¡°Waiting won¡¯t make the maid any prettier. Kiss her and be done with it.¡±
   ¡°Kiss her?¡± Ser Barristan repeated, aghast.
   ¡°A steel kiss,¡± said Littlefinger.
   Robert turned to face his Hand. ¡°Well, there it is, Ned. You and Selmy stand alone on this matter. The only question that remains is, who can we find to kill her?¡±
   ¡°Mormont craves a royal pardon,¡± Lord Renly reminded them.
   ¡°Desperately,¡± Varys said, ¡°yet he craves life even more. By now, the princess nears Vaes Dothrak, where it is death to draw a blade. If I told you what the Dothraki would do to the poor man who used one on a khaleesi, none of you would sleep tonight.¡± He stroked a powdered cheek. ¡°Now, poison?.?.?.?the tears of Lys, let us say. Khal Drogo need never know it was not a natural death.¡±
   Grand Maester Pycelle¡¯s sleepy eyes flicked open. He squinted suspiciously at the eunuch.
   ¡°Poison is a coward¡¯s weapon,¡± the king complained.
   Ned had heard enough. ¡°You send hired knives to kill a fourteen-year-old girl and still quibble about honor?¡± He pushed back his chair and stood. ¡°Do it yourself, Robert. The man who passes the sentence should swing the sword. Look her in the eyes before you kill her. See her tears, hear her last words. You owe her that much at least.¡±
   ¡°Gods,¡± the king swore, the word exploding out of him as if he could barely contain his fury. ¡°You mean it, damn you.¡± He reached for the flagon of wine at his elbow, found it empty, and flung it away to shatter against the wall. ¡°I am out of wine and out of patience. Enough of this. Just have it done.¡±
   ¡°I will not be part of murder, Robert. Do as you will, but do not ask me to fix my seal to it.¡±
   For a moment Robert did not seem to understand what Ned was saying. Defiance was not a dish he tasted often. Slowly his face changed as comprehension came. His eyes narrowed and a flush crept up his neck past the velvet collar. He pointed an angry finger at Ned. ¡°You are the King¡¯s Hand, Lord Stark. You will do as I command you, or I¡¯ll find me a Hand who will.¡±
   ¡°I wish him every success.¡± Ned unfastened the heavy clasp that clutched at the folds of his cloak, the ornate silver hand that was his badge of office. He laid it on the table in front of the king, saddened by the memory of the man who had pinned it on him, the friend he had loved. ¡°I thought you a better man than this, Robert. I thought we had made a nobler king.¡±
   Robert¡¯s face was purple. ¡°Out,¡± he croaked, choking on his rage. ¡°Out, damn you, I¡¯m done with you. What are you waiting for? Go, run back to Winterfell. And make certain I never look on your face again, or I swear, I¡¯ll have your head on a spike!¡±
   Ned bowed, and turned on his heel without another word. He could feel Robert¡¯s eyes on his back. As he strode from the council chambers, the discussion resumed with scarcely a pause. ¡°On Braavos there is a society called the Faceless Men,¡± Grand Maester Pycelle offered.
   ¡°Do you have any idea how costly they are?¡± Littlefinger complained. ¡°You could hire an army of common sellswords for half the price, and that¡¯s for a merchant. I don¡¯t dare think what they might ask for a princess.¡±
   The closing of the door behind him silenced the voices. Ser Boros Blount was stationed outside the chamber, wearing the long white cloak and armor of the Kingsguard. He gave Ned a quick, curious glance from the corner of his eye, but asked no questions.
   The day felt heavy and oppressive as he crossed the bailey back to the Tower of the Hand. He could feel the threat of rain in the air. Ned would have welcomed it. It might have made him feel a trifle less unclean. When he reached his solar, he summoned Vayon Poole. The steward came at once. ¡°You sent for me, my lord Hand?¡±
   ¡°Hand no longer,¡± Ned told him. ¡°The king and I have quarreled. We shall be returning to Winterfell.¡±
   ¡°I shall begin making arrangements at once, my lord. We will need a fortnight to ready everything for the journey.¡±
   ¡°We may not have a fortnight. We may not have a day. The king mentioned something about seeing my head on a spike.¡± Ned frowned. He did not truly believe the king would harm him, not Robert. He was angry now, but once Ned was safely out of sight, his rage would cool as it always did.
   Always? Suddenly, uncomfortably, he found himself recalling Rhaegar Targaryen. Fifteen years dead, yet Robert hates him as much as ever. It was a disturbing notion?.?.?.?and there was the other matter, the business with Catelyn and the dwarf that Yoren had warned him of last night. That would come to light soon, as sure as sunrise, and with the king in such a black fury?.?.?.?Robert might not care a fig for Tyrion Lannister, but it would touch on his pride, and there was no telling what the queen might do.
   ¡°It might be safest if I went on ahead,¡± he told Poole. ¡°I will take my daughters and a few guardsmen. The rest of you can follow when you are ready. Inform Jory, but tell no one else, and do nothing until the girls and I have gone. The castle is full of eyes and ears, and I would rather my plans were not known.¡±
   ¡°As you command, my lord.¡±
   When he had gone, Eddard Stark went to the window and sat brooding. Robert had left him no choice that he could see. He ought to thank him. It would be good to return to Winterfell. He ought never have left. His sons were waiting there. Perhaps he and Catelyn would make a new son together when he returned, they were not so old yet. And of late he had often found himself dreaming of snow, of the deep quiet of the wolfswood at night.
   And yet, the thought of leaving angered him as well. So much was still undone. Robert and his council of cravens and flatterers would beggar the realm if left unchecked?.?.?.?or, worse, sell it to the Lannisters in payment of their loans. And the truth of Jon Arryn¡¯s death still eluded him. Oh, he had found a few pieces, enough to convince him that Jon had indeed been murdered, but that was no more than the spoor of an animal on the forest floor. He had not sighted the beast itself yet, though he sensed it was there, lurking, hidden, treacherous.
   It struck him suddenly that he might return to Winterfell by sea. Ned was no sailor, and ordinarily would have preferred the kingsroad, but if he took ship he could stop at Dragonstone and speak with Stannis Baratheon. Pycelle had sent a raven off across the water, with a polite letter from Ned requesting Lord Stannis to return to his seat on the small council. As yet, there had been no reply, but the silence only deepened his suspicions. Lord Stannis shared the secret Jon Arryn had died for, he was certain of it. The truth he sought might very well be waiting for him on the ancient island fortress of House Targaryen.
   And when you have it, what then? Some secrets are safer kept hidden. Some secrets are too dangerous to share, even with those you love and trust. Ned slid the dagger that Catelyn had brought him out of the sheath on his belt. The Imp¡¯s knife. Why would the dwarf want Bran dead? To silence him, surely. Another secret, or only a different strand of the same web?
   Could Robert be part of it? He would not have thought so, but once he would not have thought Robert could command the murder of women and children either. Catelyn had tried to warn him. You knew the man, she had said. The king is a stranger to you. The sooner he was quit of King¡¯s Landing, the better. If there was a ship sailing north on the morrow, it would be well to be on it.
   He summoned Vayon Poole again and sent him to the docks to make inquiries, quietly but quickly. ¡°Find me a fast ship with a skilled captain,¡± he told the steward. ¡°I care nothing for the size of its cabins or the quality of its appointments, so long as it is swift and safe. I wish to leave at once.¡±
   Poole had no sooner taken his leave than Tomard announced a visitor. ¡°Lord Baelish to see you, m¡¯lord.¡±
   Ned was half-tempted to turn him away, but thought better of it. He was not free yet; until he was, he must play their games. ¡°Show him in, Tom.¡±
   Lord Petyr sauntered into the solar as if nothing had gone amiss that morning. He wore a slashed velvet doublet in cream-and-silver, a grey silk cloak trimmed with black fox, and his customary mocking smile.
   Ned greeted him coldly. ¡°Might I ask the reason for this visit, Lord Baelish?¡±
   ¡°I won¡¯t detain you long, I¡¯m on my way to dine with Lady Tanda. Lamprey pie and roast suckling pig. She has some thought to wed me to her younger daughter, so her table is always astonishing. If truth be told, I¡¯d sooner marry the pig, but don¡¯t tell her. I do love lamprey pie.¡±
   ¡°Don¡¯t let me keep you from your eels, my lord,¡± Ned said with icy disdain. ¡°At the moment, I cannot think of anyone whose company I desire less than yours.¡±
   ¡°Oh, I¡¯m certain if you put your mind to it, you could come up with a few names. Varys, say. Cersei. Or Robert. His Grace is most wroth with you. He went on about you at some length after you took your leave of us this morning. The words insolence and ingratitude came into it frequently, I seem to recall.¡±
   Ned did not honor that with a reply. Nor did he offer his guest a seat, but Littlefinger took one anyway. ¡°After you stormed out, it was left to me to convince them not to hire the Faceless Men,¡± he continued blithely. ¡°Instead Varys will quietly let it be known that we¡¯ll make a lord of whoever does in the Targaryen girl.¡±
   Ned was disgusted. ¡°So now we grant titles to assassins.¡±
   Littlefinger shrugged. ¡°Titles are cheap. The Faceless Men are expensive. If truth be told, I did the Targaryen girl more good than you with all your talk of honor. Let some sellsword drunk on visions of lordship try to kill her. Likely he¡¯ll make a botch of it, and afterward the Dothraki will be on their guard. If we¡¯d sent a Faceless Man after her, she¡¯d be as good as buried.¡±
   Ned frowned. ¡°You sit in council and talk of ugly women and steel kisses, and now you expect me to believe that you tried to protect the girl? How big a fool do you take me for?¡±
   ¡°Well, quite an enormous one, actually,¡± said Littlefinger, laughing.
   ¡°Do you always find murder so amusing, Lord Baelish?¡±
   ¡°It¡¯s not murder I find amusing, Lord Stark, it¡¯s you. You rule like a man dancing on rotten ice. I daresay you will make a noble splash. I believe I heard the first crack this morning.¡±
   ¡°The first and last,¡± said Ned. ¡°I¡¯ve had my fill.¡±
   ¡°When do you mean to return to Winterfell, my lord?¡±
   ¡°As soon as I can. What concern is that of yours?¡±
   ¡°None?.?.?.?but if perchance you¡¯re still here come evenfall, I¡¯d be pleased to take you to this brothel your man Jory has been searching for so ineffectually.¡± Littlefinger smiled. ¡°And I won¡¯t even tell the Lady Catelyn.¡±
   
   34£®CATELYN
   My lady, you should have sent word of your coming,¡± Ser Donnel Waynwood told her as their horses climbed the pass. ¡°We would have sent an escort. The high road is not as safe as it once was, for a party as small as yours.¡±
   ¡°We learned that to our sorrow, Ser Donnel,¡± Catelyn said. Sometimes she felt as though her heart had turned to stone; six brave men had died to bring her this far, and she could not even find it in her to weep for them. Even their names were fading. ¡°The clansmen harried us day and night. We lost three men in the first attack, and two more in the second, and Lannister¡¯s serving man died of a fever when his wounds festered. When we heard your men approaching, I thought us doomed for certain.¡± They had drawn up for a last desperate fight, blades in hand and backs to the rock. The dwarf had been whetting the edge of his axe and making some mordant jest when Bronn spotted the banner the riders carried before them, the moon-and-falcon of House Arryn, sky-blue and white. Catelyn had never seen a more welcome sight.
   ¡°The clans have grown bolder since Lord Jon died,¡± Ser Donnel said. He was a stocky youth of twenty years, earnest and homely, with a wide nose and a shock of thick brown hair. ¡°If it were up to me, I would take a hundred men into the mountains, root them out of their fastnesses, and teach them some sharp lessons, but your sister has forbidden it. She would not even permit her knights to fight in the Hand¡¯s tourney. She wants all our swords kept close to home, to defend the Vale?.?.?.?against what, no one is certain. Shadows, some say.¡± He looked at her anxiously, as if he had suddenly remembered who she was. ¡°I hope I have not spoken out of turn, my lady. I meant no offense.¡±
   ¡°Frank talk does not offend me, Ser Donnel.¡± Catelyn knew what her sister feared. Not shadows, Lannisters, she thought to herself, glancing back to where the dwarf rode beside Bronn. The two of them had grown thick as thieves since Chiggen had died. The little man was more cunning than she liked. When they had entered the mountains, he had been her captive, bound and helpless. What was he now? Her captive still, yet he rode along with a dirk through his belt and an axe strapped to his saddle, wearing the shadowskin cloak he¡¯d won dicing with the singer and the chainmail hauberk he¡¯d taken off Chiggen¡¯s corpse. Two score men flanked the dwarf and the rest of her ragged band, knights and men-at-arms in service to her sister Lysa and Jon Arryn¡¯s young son, and yet Tyrion betrayed no hint of fear. Could I be wrong? Catelyn wondered, not for the first time. Could he be innocent after all, of Bran and Jon Arryn and all the rest? And if he was, what did that make her? Six men had died to bring him here.
   Resolute, she pushed her doubts away. ¡°When we reach your keep, I would take it kindly if you could send for Maester Colemon at once. Ser Rodrik is feverish from his wounds.¡± More than once she had feared the gallant old knight would not survive the journey. Toward the end he could scarcely sit his horse, and Bronn had urged her to leave him to his fate, but Catelyn would not hear of it. They had tied him in the saddle instead, and she had commanded Marillion the singer to watch over him.
   Ser Donnel hesitated before he answered. ¡°The Lady Lysa has commanded the maester to remain at the Eyrie at all times, to care for Lord Robert,¡± he said. ¡°We have a septon at the gate who tends to our wounded. He can see to your man¡¯s hurts.¡±
   Catelyn had more faith in a maester¡¯s learning than a septon¡¯s prayers. She was about to say as much when she saw the battlements ahead, long parapets built into the very stone of the mountains on either side of them. Where the pass shrank to a narrow defile scarce wide enough for four men to ride abreast, twin watchtowers clung to the rocky slopes, joined by a covered bridge of weathered grey stone that arched above the road. Silent faces watched from arrow slits in tower, battlements, and bridge. When they had climbed almost to the top, a knight rode out to meet them. His horse and his armor were grey, but his cloak was the rippling blue-and-red of Riverrun, and a shiny black fish, wrought in gold and obsidian, pinned its folds against his shoulder. ¡°Who would pass the Bloody Gate?¡± he called.
   ¡°Ser Donnel Waynwood, with the Lady Catelyn Stark and her companions,¡± the young knight answered.
   The Knight of the Gate lifted his visor. ¡°I thought the lady looked familiar. You are far from home, little Cat.¡±
   ¡°And you, Uncle,¡± she said, smiling despite all she had been through. Hearing that hoarse, smoky voice again took her back twenty years, to the days of her childhood.
   ¡°My home is at my back,¡± he said gruffly.
   ¡°Your home is in my heart,¡± Catelyn told him. ¡°Take off your helm. I would look on your face again.¡±
   ¡°The years have not improved it, I fear,¡± Brynden Tully said, but when he lifted off the helm, Catelyn saw that he lied. His features were lined and weathered, and time had stolen the auburn from his hair and left him only grey, but the smile was the same, and the bushy eyebrows fat as caterpillars, and the laughter in his deep blue eyes. ¡°Did Lysa know you were coming?¡±
   ¡°There was no time to send word ahead,¡± Catelyn told him. The others were coming up behind her. ¡°I fear we ride before the storm, Uncle.¡±
   ¡°May we enter the Vale?¡± Ser Donnel asked. The Waynwoods were ever ones for ceremony.
   ¡°In the name of Robert Arryn, Lord of the Eyrie, Defender of the Vale, True Warden of the East, I bid you enter freely, and charge you to keep his peace,¡± Ser Brynden replied. ¡°Come.¡±
   And so she rode behind him, beneath the shadow of the Bloody Gate where a dozen armies had dashed themselves to pieces in the Age of Heroes. On the far side of the stoneworks, the mountains opened up suddenly upon a vista of green fields, blue sky, and snowcapped mountains that took her breath away. The Vale of Arryn bathed in the morning light.
   It stretched before them to the misty cast, a tranquil land of rich black soil, wide slow-moving rivers, and hundreds of small lakes that shone like mirrors in the sun, protected on all sides by its sheltering peaks. Wheat and corn and barley grew high in its fields, and even in Highgarden the pumpkins were no larger nor the fruit any sweeter than here. They stood at the western end of the valley, where the high road crested the last pass and began its winding descent to the bottomlands two miles below. The Vale was narrow here, no more than a half day¡¯s ride across, and the northern mountains seemed so close that Catelyn could almost reach out and touch them. Looming over them all was the jagged peak called the Giant¡¯s Lance, a mountain that even mountains looked up to, its head lost in icy mists three and a half miles above the valley floor. Over its massive western shoulder flowed the ghost torrent of Alyssa¡¯s Tears. Even from this distance, Catelyn could make out the shining silver thread, bright against the dark stone.
   When her uncle saw that she had stopped, he moved his horse closer and pointed. ¡°It¡¯s there, beside Alyssa¡¯s Tears. All you can see from here is a flash of white every now and then, if you look hard and the sun hits the walls just right.¡±
   Seven towers, Ned had told her, like white daggers thrust into the belly of the sky, so high you can stand on the parapets and look down on the clouds. ¡°How long a ride?¡± she asked.
   ¡°We can be at the mountain by evenfall,¡± Uncle Brynden said, ¡°but the climb will take another day.¡±
   Ser Rodrik Cassel spoke up from behind. ¡°My lady,¡± he said, ¡°I fear I can go no farther today.¡± His face sagged beneath his ragged, newgrown whiskers, and he looked so weary Catelyn feared he might fall off his horse.
   ¡°Nor should you,¡± she said. ¡°You have done all I could have asked of you, and a hundred times more. My uncle will see me the rest of the way to the Eyrie. Lannister must come with me, but there is no reason that you and the others should not rest here and recover your strength.¡±
   ¡°We should be honored to have them to guest,¡± Ser Donnel said with the grave courtesy of the young. Beside Ser Rodrik, only Bronn, Ser Willis Wode, and Marillion the singer remained of the party that had ridden with her from the inn by the crossroads.
   ¡°My lady,¡± Marillion said, riding forward. ¡°I beg you allow me to accompany you to the Eyrie, to see the end of the tale as I saw its beginnings.¡± The boy sounded haggard, yet strangely determined; he had a fevered shine to his eyes.
   Catelyn had never asked the singer to ride with them; that choice he had made himself, and how he had come to survive the journey when so many braver men lay dead and unburied behind them, she could never say. Yet here he was, with a scruff of beard that made him look almost a man. Perhaps she owed him something for having come this far. ¡°Very well,¡± she told him.
   ¡°I¡¯ll come as well,¡± Bronn announced.
   She liked that less well. Without Bronn she would never have reached the Vale, she knew; the sellsword was as fierce a fighter as she had ever seen, and his sword had helped cut them through to safety. Yet for all that, Catelyn misliked the man. Courage he had, and strength, but there was no kindness in him, and little loyalty. And she had seen him riding beside Lannister far too often, talking in low voices and laughing at some private joke. She would have preferred to separate him from the dwarf here and now, but having agreed that Marillion might continue to the Eyrie, she could see no gracious way to deny that same right to Bronn. ¡°As you wish,¡± she said, although she noted that he had not actually asked her permission.
   Ser Willis Wode remained with Ser Rodrik, a soft-spoken septon fussing over their wounds. Their horses were left behind as well, poor ragged things. Ser Donnel promised to send birds ahead to the Eyrie and the Gates of the Moon with the word of their coming. Fresh mounts were brought forth from the stables, surefooted mountain stock with shaggy coats, and within the hour they set forth once again. Catelyn rode beside her uncle as they began the descent to the valley floor. Behind came Bronn, Tyrion Lannister, Marillion, and six of Brynden¡¯s men.
   Not until they were a third of the way down the mountain path, well out of earshot of the others, did Brynden Tully turn to her and say, ¡°So, child. Tell me about this storm of yours.¡±
   ¡°I have not been a child in many years, Uncle,¡± Catelyn said, but she told him nonetheless. It took longer than she would have believed to tell it all, Lysa¡¯s letter and Bran¡¯s fall, the assassin¡¯s dagger and Littlefinger and her chance meeting with Tyrion Lannister in the crossroads inn.
   Her uncle listened silently, heavy brows shadowing his eyes as his frown grew deeper. Brynden Tully had always known how to listen?.?.?.?to anyone but her father. He was Lord Hoster¡¯s brother, younger by five years, but the two of them had been at war as far back as Catelyn could remember. During one of their louder quarrels, when Catelyn was eight, Lord Hoster had called Brynden ¡°the black goat of the Tully flock.¡± Laughing, Brynden had pointed out that the sigil of their house was a leaping trout, so he ought to be a black fish rather than a black goat, and from that day forward he had taken it as his personal emblem.
   The war had not ended until the day she and Lysa had been wed. It was at their wedding feast that Brynden told his brother he was leaving Riverrun to serve Lysa and her new husband, the Lord of the Eyrie. Lord Hoster had not spoken his brother¡¯s name since, from what Edmure told her in his infrequent letters.
   Nonetheless, during all those years of Catelyn¡¯s girlhood, it had been Brynden the Blackfish to whom Lord Hoster¡¯s children had run with their tears and their tales, when Father was too busy and Mother too ill. Catelyn, Lysa, Edmure?.?.?.?and yes, even Petyr Baelish, their father¡¯s ward?.?.?.?he had listened to them all patiently, as he listened now, laughing at their triumphs and sympathizing with their childish misfortunes.
   When she was done, her uncle remained silent for a long time, as his horse negotiated the steep, rocky trail. ¡°Your father must be told,¡± he said at last. ¡°If the Lannisters should march, Winterfell is remote and the Vale walled up behind its mountains, but Riverrun lies right in their path.¡±
   ¡°I¡¯d had the same fear,¡± Catelyn admitted. ¡°I shall ask Maester Colemon to send a bird when we reach the Eyrie.¡± She had other messages to send as well; the commands that Ned had given her for his bannermen, to ready the defenses of the north. ¡°What is the mood in the Vale?¡± she asked.
   ¡°Angry,¡± Brynden Tully admitted. ¡°Lord Jon was much loved, and the insult was keenly felt when the king named Jaime Lannister to an office the Arryns had held for near three hundred years. Lysa has commanded us to call her son the True Warden of the East, but no one is fooled. Nor is your sister alone in wondering at the manner of the Hand¡¯s death. None dare say Jon was murdered, not openly, but suspicion casts a long shadow.¡± He gave Catelyn a look, his mouth tight. ¡°And there is the boy.¡±
   ¡°The boy? What of him?¡± She ducked her head as they passed under a low overhang of rock, and around a sharp turn.
   Her uncle¡¯s voice was troubled. ¡°Lord Robert,¡± he sighed. ¡°Six years old, sickly, and prone to weep if you take his dolls away. Jon Arryn¡¯s trueborn heir, by all the gods, yet there are some who say he is too weak to sit his father¡¯s seat, Nestor Royce has been high steward these past fourteen years, while Lord Jon served in King¡¯s Landing, and many whisper that he should rule until the boy comes of age. Others believe that Lysa must marry again, and soon. Already the suitors gather like crows on a battlefield. The Eyrie is full of them.¡±
   ¡°I might have expected that,¡± Catelyn said. Small wonder there; Lysa was still young, and the kingdom of Mountain and Vale made a handsome wedding gift. ¡°Will Lysa take another husband?¡±
   ¡°She says yes, provided she finds a man who suits her,¡± Brynden Tully said, ¡°but she has already rejected Lord Nestor and a dozen other suitable men. She swears that this time she will choose her lord husband.¡±
   ¡°You of all people can scarce fault her for that.¡±
   Ser Brynden snorted. ¡°Nor do I, but?.?.?.?it seems to me Lysa is only playing at courtship. She enjoys the sport, but I believe your sister intends to rule herself until her boy is old enough to be Lord of the Eyrie in truth as well as name.¡±
   ¡°A woman can rule as wisely as a man,¡± Catelyn said.
   ¡°The right woman can,¡± her uncle said with a sideways glance. ¡°Make no mistake, Cat. Lysa is not you.¡± He hesitated a moment. ¡°If truth be told, I fear you may not find your sister as helpful as you would like.¡±
   She was puzzled. ¡°What do you mean?¡±
   ¡°The Lysa who came back from King¡¯s Landing is not the same girl who went south when her husband was named Hand. Those years were hard for her. You must know. Lord Arryn was a dutiful husband, but their marriage was made from politics, not passion.¡±
   ¡°As was my own.¡±
   ¡°They began the same, but your ending has been happier than your sister¡¯s. Two babes stillborn, twice as many miscarriages, Lord Arryn¡¯s death?.?.?.?Catelyn, the gods gave Lysa only the one child, and he is all your sister lives for now, poor boy. Small wonder she fled rather than see him handed over to the Lannisters. Your sister is afraid, child, and the Lannisters are what she fears most. She ran to the Vale, stealing away from the Red Keep like a thief in the night, and all to snatch her son out of the lion¡¯s mouth?.?.?.?and now you have brought the lion to her door.¡±
   ¡°In chains,¡± Catelyn said. A crevasse yawned on her right, falling away into darkness. She reined up her horse and picked her way along step by careful step.
   ¡°Oh?¡± Her uncle glanced back, to where Tyrion Lannister was making his slow descent behind them. ¡°I see an axe on his saddle, a dirk at his belt, and a sellsword that trails after him like a hungry shadow. Where are the chains, sweet one?¡±
   Catelyn shifted uneasily in her seat. ¡°The dwarf is here, and not by choice. Chains or no, he is my prisoner. Lysa will want him to answer for his crimes no less than I. It was her own lord husband the Lannisters murdered, and her own letter that first warned us against them.¡±
   Brynden Blackfish gave her a weary smile. ¡°I hope you are right, child,¡± he sighed, in tones that said she was wrong.
   The sun was well to the west by the time the slope began to flatten beneath the hooves of their horses. The road widened and grew straight, and for the first time Catelyn noticed wildflowers and grasses growing. Once they reached the valley floor, the going was faster and they made good time, cantering through verdant greenwoods and sleepy little hamlets, past orchards and golden wheat fields, splashing across a dozen sunlit streams. Her uncle sent a standard-bearer ahead of them, a double banner flying from his staff; the moon-and-falcon of House Arryn on high, and below it his own black fish. Farm wagons and merchants¡¯ carts and riders from lesser houses moved aside to let them pass.
   Even so, it was full dark before they reached the stout castle that stood at the foot of the Giant¡¯s Lance. Torches flickered atop its ramparts, and the horned moon danced upon the dark waters of its moat. The drawbridge was up and the portcullis down, but Catelyn saw lights burning in the gatehouse and spilling from the windows of the square towers beyond.
   ¡°The Gates of the Moon,¡± her uncle said as the party drew rein. His standard-bearer rode to the edge of the moat to hail the men in the gatehouse. ¡°Lord Nestor¡¯s seat. He should be expecting us. Look up.¡±
   Catelyn raised her eyes, up and up and up. At first all she saw was stone and trees, the looming mass of the great mountain shrouded in night, as black as a starless sky. Then she noticed the glow of distant fires well above them; a tower keep, built upon the steep side of the mountain, its lights like orange eyes staring down from above. Above that was another, higher and more distant, and still higher a third, no more than a flickering spark in the sky. And finally, up where the falcons soared, a flash of white in the moonlight. Vertigo washed over her as she stared upward at the pale towers, so far above.
   ¡°The Eyrie,¡± she heard Marillion murmur, awed.
   The sharp voice of Tyrion Lannister broke in. ¡°The Arryns must not be overfond of company. If you¡¯re planning to make us climb that mountain in the dark, I¡¯d rather you kill me here.¡±
   ¡°We¡¯ll spend the night here and make the ascent on the morrow,¡± Brynden told him.
   ¡°I can scarcely wait,¡± the dwarf replied. ¡°How do we get up there? I¡¯ve no experience at riding goats.¡±
   ¡°Mules,¡± Brynden said, smiling.
   ¡°There are steps carved into the mountain,¡± Catelyn said. Ned had told her about them when he talked of his youth here with Robert Baratheon and Jon Arryn.
   Her uncle nodded. ¡°It is too dark to see them, but the steps are there. Too steep and narrow for horses, but mules can manage them most of the way. The path is guarded by three waycastles, Stone and Snow and Sky. The mules will take us as far up as Sky.¡±
   Tyrion Lannister glanced up doubtfully. ¡°And beyond that?¡±
   Brynden smiled. ¡°Beyond that, the path is too steep even for mules. We ascend on foot the rest of the way. Or perchance you¡¯d prefer to ride a basket. The Eyrie clings to the mountain directly above Sky, and in its cellars are six great winches with long iron chains to draw supplies up from below. If you prefer, my lord of Lannister, I can arrange for you to ride up with the bread and beer and apples.¡±
   The dwarf gave a bark of laughter. ¡°Would that I were a pumpkin,¡± he said. ¡°Alas, my lord father would no doubt be most chagrined if his son of Lannister went to his fate like a load of turnips. If you ascend on foot, I fear I must do the same. We Lannisters do have a certain pride.¡±
   ¡°Pride?¡± Catelyn snapped. His mocking tone and easy manner made her angry. ¡°Arrogance, some might call it. Arrogance and avarice and lust for power.¡±
   ¡°My brother is undoubtedly arrogant,¡± Tyrion Lannister replied. ¡°My father is the soul of avarice, and my sweet sister Cersei lusts for power with every waking breath. I, however, am innocent as a little lamb. Shall I bleat for you?¡± He grinned.
   The drawbridge came creaking down before she could reply, and they heard the sound of oiled chains as the portcullis was drawn up. Men-at-arms carried burning brands out to light their way, and her uncle led them across the moat. Lord Nestor Royce, High Steward of the Vale and Keeper of the Gates of the Moon, was waiting in the yard to greet them, surrounded by his knights. ¡°Lady Stark,¡± he said, bowing. He was a massive, barrel-chested man, and his bow was clumsy.
   Catelyn dismounted to stand before him. ¡°Lord Nestor,¡± she said. She knew the man only by reputation; Bronze Yohn¡¯s cousin, from a lesser branch of House Royce, yet still a formidable lord in his own right. ¡°We have had a long and tiring journey. I would beg the hospitality of your roof tonight, if I might.¡±
   ¡°My roof is yours, my lady,¡± Lord Nestor returned gruffly, ¡°but your sister the Lady Lysa has sent down word from the Eyrie. She wishes to see you at once. The rest of your party will be housed here and sent up at first light.¡±
   Her uncle swung off his horse. ¡°What madness is this?¡± he said bluntly. Brynden Tully had never been a man to blunt the edge of his words. ¡°A night ascent, with the moon not even full? Even Lysa should know that¡¯s an invitation to a broken neck.¡±
   ¡°The mules know the way, Ser Brynden.¡± A wiry girl of seventeen or eighteen years stepped up beside Lord Nestor. Her dark hair was cropped short and straight around her head, and she wore riding leathers and a light shirt of silvered ringmail. She bowed to Catelyn, more gracefully than her lord. ¡°I promise you, my lady, no harm will come to you. It would be my honor to take you up. I¡¯ve made the dark climb a hundred times. Mychel says my father must have been a goat.¡±
   She sounded so cocky that Catelyn had to smile. ¡°Do you have a name, child?¡±
   ¡°Mya Stone, if it please you, my lady,¡± the girl said.
   It did not please her; it was an effort for Catelyn to keep the smile on her face. Stone was a bastard¡¯s name in the Vale, as Snow was in the north, and Flowers in Highgarden; in each of the Seven Kingdoms, custom had fashioned a surname for children born with no names of their own. Catelyn had nothing against this girl, but suddenly she could not help but think of Ned¡¯s bastard on the Wall, and the thought made her angry and guilty, both at once. She struggled to find words for a reply.
   Lord Nestor filled the silence. ¡°Mya¡¯s a clever girl, and if she vows she will bring you safely to the Lady Lysa, I believe her. She has not failed me yet.¡±
   ¡°Then I put myself in your hands, Mya Stone,¡± Catelyn said. ¡°Lord Nestor, I charge you to keep a close guard on my prisoner.¡±
   ¡°And I charge you to bring the prisoner a cup of wine and a nicely crisped capon, before he dies of hunger,¡± Lannister said. ¡°A girl would be pleasant as well, but I suppose that¡¯s too much to ask of you.¡± The sellsword Bronn laughed aloud.
   Lord Nestor ignored the banter. ¡°As you say, my lady, so it will be done.¡± Only then did he look at the dwarf. ¡°See our lord of Lannister to a tower cell, and bring him meat and mead.¡±
   Catelyn took her leave of her uncle and the others as Tyrion Lannister was led off, then followed the bastard girl through the castle. Two mules were waiting in the upper bailey, saddled and ready. Mya helped her mount one while a guardsman in a sky-blue cloak opened the narrow postern gate. Beyond was dense forest of pine and spruce, and the mountain like a black wall, but the steps were there, chiseled deep into the rock, ascending into the sky. ¡°Some people find it easier if they close their eyes,¡± Mya said as she led the mules through the gate into the dark wood. ¡°When they get frightened or dizzy, sometimes they hold on to the mule too tight. They don¡¯t like that.¡±
   ¡°I was born a Tully and wed to a Stark,¡± Catelyn said. ¡°I do not frighten easily. Do you plan to light a torch?¡± The steps were black as pitch.
   The girl made a face. ¡°Torches just blind you. On a clear night like this, the moon and the stars are enough. Mychel says I have the eyes of the owl.¡± She mounted and urged her mule up the first step. Catelyn¡¯s animal followed of its own accord.
   ¡°You mentioned Mychel before,¡± Catelyn said. The mules set the pace, slow but steady. She was perfectly content with that.
   ¡°Mychel¡¯s my love,¡± Mya explained. ¡°Mychel Redfort. He¡¯s squire to Ser Lyn Corbray. We¡¯re to wed as soon as he becomes a knight, next year or the year after.¡±
   She sounded so like Sansa, so happy and innocent with her dreams. Catelyn smiled, but the smile was tinged with sadness. The Redforts were an old name in the Vale, she knew, with the blood of the First Men in their veins. His love she might be, but no Redfort would ever wed a bastard. His family would arrange a more suitable match for him, to a Corbray or a Waynwood or a Royce, or perhaps a daughter of some greater house outside the Vale. If Mychel Redfort laid with this girl at all, it would be on the wrong side of the sheet.
   The ascent was easier than Catelyn had dared hope. The trees pressed close, leaning over the path to make a rustling green roof that shut out even the moon, so it seemed as though they were moving up a long black tunnel. But the mules were surefooted and tireless, and Mya Stone did indeed seem blessed with night-eyes. They plodded upward, winding their way back and forth across the face of the mountain as the steps twisted and turned. A thick layer of fallen needles carpeted the path, so the shoes of their mules made only the softest sound on the rock. The quiet soothed her, and the gentle rocking motion set Catelyn to swaying in her saddle. Before long she was fighting sleep.
   Perhaps she did doze for a moment, for suddenly a massive ironbound gate was looming before them. ¡°Stone,¡± Mya announced cheerily, dismounting. Iron spikes were set along the tops of formidable stone walls, and two fat round towers overtopped the keep. The gate swung open at Mya¡¯s shout. Inside, the portly knight who commanded the waycastle greeted Mya by name and offered them skewers of charred meat and onions still hot from the spit. Catelyn had not realized how hungry she was. She ate standing in the yard, as stablehands moved their saddles to fresh mules. The hot juices ran down her chin and dripped onto her cloak, but she was too famished to care.
   Then it was up onto a new mule and out again into the starlight. The second part of the ascent seemed more treacherous to Catelyn. The trail was steeper, the steps more worn, and here and there littered with pebbles and broken stone. Mya had to dismount a half-dozen times to move fallen rocks from their path. ¡°You don¡¯t want your mule to break a leg up here,¡± she said. Catelyn was forced to agree. She could feel the altitude more now. The trees were sparser up here, and the wind blew more vigorously, sharp gusts that tugged at her clothing and pushed her hair into her eyes. From time to time the steps doubled back on themselves, and she could see Stone below them, and the Gates of the Moon farther down, its torches no brighter than candles.
   Snow was smaller than Stone, a single fortified tower and a timber keep and stable hidden behind a low wall of unmortared rock. Yet it nestled against the Giant¡¯s Lance in such a way as to command the entire stone stair above the lower waycastle. An enemy intent on the Eyrie would have to fight his way from Stone step by step, while rocks and arrows rained down from Snow above. The commander, an anxious young knight with a pockmarked face, offered bread and cheese and the chance to warm themselves before his fire, but Mya declined. ¡°We ought to keep going, my lady,¡± she said. ¡°If it please you.¡± Catelyn nodded.
   Again they were given fresh mules. Hers was white. Mya smiled when she saw him. ¡°Whitey¡¯s a good one, my lady. Sure of foot, even on ice, but you need to be careful. He¡¯ll kick if he doesn¡¯t like you.¡±
   The white mule seemed to like Catelyn; there was no kicking, thank the gods. There was no ice either, and she was grateful for that as well. ¡°My mother says that hundreds of years ago, this was where the snow began,¡± Mya told her. ¡°It was always white above here, and the ice never melted.¡± She shrugged. ¡°I can¡¯t remember ever seeing snow this far down the mountain, but maybe it was that way once, in the olden times.¡±
   So young, Catelyn thought, trying to remember if she had ever been like that. The girl had lived half her life in summer, and that was all she knew. Winter is coming, child, she wanted to tell her. The words were on her lips; she almost said them. Perhaps she was becoming a Stark at last.
   Above Snow, the wind was a living thing, howling around them like a wolf in the waste, then falling off to nothing as if to lure them into complacency. The stars seemed brighter up here, so close that she could almost touch them, and the horned moon was huge in the clear black sky. As they climbed, Catelyn found it was better to look up than down. The steps were cracked and broken from centuries of freeze and thaw and the tread of countless mules, and even in the dark the heights put her heart in her throat. When they came to a high saddle between two spires of rock, Mya dismounted. ¡°It¡¯s best to lead the mules over,¡± she said. ¡°The wind can be a little scary here, my lady.¡±
   Catelyn climbed stiffly from the shadows and looked at the path ahead; twenty feet long and close to three feet wide, but with a precipitous drop to either side. She could hear the wind shrieking. Mya stepped lightly out, her mule following as calmly as if they were crossing a bailey. It was her turn. Yet no sooner had she taken her first step than fear caught Catelyn in its jaws. She could feel the emptiness, the vast black gulfs of air that yawned around her. She stopped, trembling, afraid to move. The wind screamed at her and wrenched at her cloak, trying to pull her over the edge. Catelyn edged her foot backward, the most timid of steps, but the mule was behind her, and she could not retreat. I am going to die here, she thought. She could feel cold sweat trickling down her back.
   ¡°Lady Stark,¡± Mya called across the gulf. The girl sounded a thousand leagues away. ¡°Are you well?¡±
   Catelyn Tully Stark swallowed what remained of her pride. ¡°I?.?.?.?I cannot do this, child,¡± she called out.
   ¡°Yes you can,¡± the bastard girl said. ¡°I know you can. Look how wide the path is.¡±
   ¡°I don¡¯t want to look.¡± The world seemed to be spinning around her, mountain and sky and mules, whirling like a child¡¯s top. Catelyn closed her eyes to steady her ragged breathing.
   ¡°I¡¯ll come back for you,¡± Mya said. ¡°Don¡¯t move, my lady.¡±
   Moving was about the last thing Catelyn was about to do. She listened to the skirling of the wind and the scuffling sound of leather on stone. Then Mya was there, taking her gently by the arm. ¡°Keep your eyes closed if you like. Let go of the rope now, Whitey will take care of himself. Very good, my lady. I¡¯ll lead you over, it¡¯s easy, you¡¯ll see. Give me a step now. That¡¯s it, move your foot, just slide it forward. See. Now another. Easy. You could run across. Another one, go on. Yes.¡± And so, foot by foot, step by step, the bastard girl led Catelyn across, blind and trembling, while the white mule followed placidly behind them.
   The waycastle called Sky was no more than a high, crescent-shaped wall of unmortared stone raised against the side of the mountain, but even the topless towers of Valyria could not have looked more beautiful to Catelyn Stark. Here at last the snow crown began; Sky¡¯s weathered stones were rimed with frost, and long spears of ice hung from the slopes above.
   Dawn was breaking in the east as Mya Stone hallooed for the guards, and the gates opened before them. Inside the walls there was only a series of ramps and a great tumble of boulders and stones of all sizes. No doubt it would be the easiest thing in the world to begin an avalanche from here. A mouth yawned in the rock face in front of them. ¡°The stables and barracks are in there,¡± Mya said. ¡°The last part is inside the mountain. It can be a little dark, but at least you¡¯re out of the wind. This is as far as the mules can go. Past here, well, it¡¯s a sort of chimney, more like a stone ladder than proper steps, but it¡¯s not too bad. Another hour and we¡¯ll be there.¡±
   Catelyn looked up. Directly overhead, pale in the dawn light, she could see the foundations of the Eyrie. It could not be more than six hundred feet above them. From below it looked like a small white honeycomb. She remembered what her uncle had said of baskets and winches. ¡°The Lannisters may have their pride,¡± she told Mya, ¡°but the Tullys are born with better sense. I have ridden all day and the best part of a night. Tell them to lower a basket. I shall ride with the turnips.¡±
   The sun was well above the mountains by the time Catelyn Stark finally reached the Eyrie. A stocky, silver-haired man in a sky-blue cloak and hammered moon-and-falcon breastplate helped her from the basket; Ser Vardis Egen, captain of Jon Arryn¡¯s household guard. Beside him stood Maester Colemon, thin and nervous, with too little hair and too much neck. ¡°Lady Stark,¡± Ser Vardis said, ¡°the pleasure is as great as it is unanticipated.¡± Maester Colemon bobbed his head in agreement. ¡°Indeed it is, my lady, indeed it is. I have sent word to your sister. She left orders to be awakened the instant you arrived.¡±
   ¡°I hope she had a good night¡¯s rest,¡± Catelyn said with a certain bite in her tone that seemed to go unnoticed.
   The men escorted her from the winch room up a spiral stair. The Eyrie was a small castle by the standards of the great houses; seven slender white towers bunched as tightly as arrows in a quiver on a shoulder of the great mountain. It had no need of stables nor smithys nor kennels, but Ned said its granary was as large as Winterfell¡¯s, and its towers could house five hundred men. Yet it seemed strangely deserted to Catelyn as she passed through it, its pale stone halls echoing and empty.
   Lysa was waiting alone in her solar, still clad in her bed robes. Her long auburn hair tumbled unbound across bare white shoulders and down her back. A maid stood behind her, brushing out the night¡¯s tangles, but when Catelyn entered, her sister rose to her feet, smiling. ¡°Cat,¡± she said. ¡°Oh, Cat, how good it is to see you. My sweet sister.¡± She ran across the chamber and wrapped her sister in her arms. ¡°How long it has been,¡± Lysa murmured against her. ¡°Oh, how very very long.¡±
   It had been five years, in truth; five cruel years, for Lysa. They had taken their toll. Her sister was two years the younger, yet she looked older now. Shorter than Catelyn, Lysa had grown thick of body, pale and puffy of face. She had the blue eyes of the Tullys, but hers were pale and watery, never still. Her small mouth had turned petulant. As Catelyn held her, she remembered the slender, high-breasted girl who¡¯d waited beside her that day in the sept at Riverrun. How lovely and full of hope she had been. All that remained of her sister¡¯s beauty was the great fall of thick auburn hair that cascaded to her waist.
   ¡°You look well,¡± Catelyn lied, ¡°but?.?.?.?tired.¡±
   Her sister broke the embrace. ¡°Tired. Yes. Oh, yes.¡± She seemed to notice the others then; her maid, Maester Colemon, Ser Vardis. ¡°Leave us,¡± she told them. ¡°I wish to speak to my sister alone.¡± She held Catelyn¡¯s hand as they withdrew?.?.?.?
   ?.?.?.?and dropped it the instant the door closed. Catelyn saw her face change. It was as if the sun had gone behind a cloud. ¡°Have you taken leave of your senses?¡± Lysa snapped at her. ¡°To bring him here, without a word of permission, without so much as a warning, to drag us into your quarrels with the Lannisters?.?.?.?¡±
   ¡°My quarrels?¡± Catelyn could scarce believe what she was hearing. A great fire burned in the hearth, but there was no trace of warmth in Lysa¡¯s voice. ¡°They were your quarrels first, sister. It was you who sent me that cursed letter, you who wrote that the Lannisters had murdered your husband.¡±
   ¡°To warn you, so you could stay away from them! I never meant to fight them! Gods, Cat, do you know what you¡¯ve done?¡±
   ¡°Mother?¡± a small voice said. Lysa whirled, her heavy robe swirling around her. Robert Arryn, Lord of the Eyrie, stood in the doorway, clutching a ragged cloth doll and looking at them with large eyes. He was a painfully thin child, small for his age and sickly all his days, and from time to time he trembled. The shaking sickness, the maesters called it. ¡°I heard voices.¡±
   Small wonder, Catelyn thought; Lysa had almost been shouting. Still, her sister looked daggers at her. ¡°This is your aunt Catelyn, baby. My sister, Lady Stark. Do you remember?¡±
   The boy glanced at her blankly. ¡°I think so,¡± he said, blinking, though he had been less than a year old the last time Catelyn had seen him.
   Lysa seated herself near the fire and said, ¡°Come to Mother, my sweet one.¡± She straightened his bedclothes and fussed with his fine brown hair. ¡°Isn¡¯t he beautiful? And strong too, don¡¯t you believe the things you hear. Jon knew. The seed is strong, he told me. His last words. He kept saying Robert¡¯s name, and he grabbed my arm so hard he left marks. Tell them, the seed is strong. His seed. He wanted everyone to know what a good strong boy my baby was going to be.¡±
   ¡°Lysa,¡± Catelyn said, ¡°if you¡¯re right about the Lannisters, all the more reason we must act quickly. We...¡±
   ¡°Not in front of the baby,¡± Lysa said. ¡°He has a delicate temper, don¡¯t you, sweet one?¡±
   ¡°The boy is Lord of the Eyrie and Defender of the Vale,¡± Catelyn reminded her, ¡°and these are no times for delicacy. Ned thinks it may come to war.¡±
   ¡°Quiet!¡± Lysa snapped at her. ¡°You¡¯re scaring the boy.¡± Little Robert took a quick peek over his shoulder at Catelyn and began to tremble. His doll fell to the rushes, and he pressed himself against his mother. ¡°Don¡¯t be afraid, my sweet baby,¡± Lysa whispered. ¡°Mother¡¯s here, nothing will hurt you.¡± She opened her robe and drew out a pale, heavy breast, tipped with red. The boy grabbed for it eagerly, buried his face against her chest, and began to suck. Lysa stroked his hair.
   Catelyn was at a loss for words. Jon Arryn¡¯s son, she thought incredulously. She remembered her own baby, three-year-old Rickon, half the age of this boy and five times as fierce. Small wonder the lords of the Vale were restive. For the first time she understood why the king had tried to take the child away from his mother to foster with the Lannisters?.?.?.?
   ¡°We¡¯re safe here,¡± Lysa was saying. Whether to her or to the boy, Catelyn was not sure.
   ¡°Don¡¯t be a fool,¡± Catelyn said, the anger rising in her. ¡°No one is safe. If you think hiding here will make the Lannisters forget you, you are sadly mistaken.¡±
   Lysa covered her boy¡¯s ear with her hand. ¡°Even if they could bring an army through the mountains and past the Bloody Gate, the Eyrie is impregnable. You saw for yourself. No enemy could ever reach us up here.¡±
   Catelyn wanted to slap her. Uncle Brynden had tried to warn her, she realized. ¡°No castle is impregnable.¡±
   ¡°This one is,¡± Lysa insisted. ¡°Everyone says so. The only thing is, what am I to do with this Imp you have brought me?¡±
   ¡°Is he a bad man?¡± the Lord of the Eyrie asked, his mother¡¯s breast popping from his mouth, the nipple wet and red.
   ¡°A very bad man,¡± Lysa told him as she covered herself, ¡°but Mother won¡¯t let him harm my little baby.¡±
   ¡°Make him fly,¡± Robert said eagerly.
   Lysa stroked her son¡¯s hair. ¡°Perhaps we will,¡± she murmured. ¡°Perhaps that is just what we will do.¡±
   ?
   
   ¡°Good,¡± said King Joffrey. Lord Janos strode from the hall, his ugly sons double-stepping to keep up as they lugged the great metal shield with the arms of House Slynt.
   ¡°Your Grace,¡± Littlefinger reminded the king. ¡°If we might resume, the seven are now six. We find ourselves in need of a new sword for your Kingsguard.¡±
   Joffrey smiled. ¡°Tell them, Mother.¡±
   ¡°The king and council have determined that no man in the Seven Kingdoms is more fit to guard and protect His Grace than his sworn shield, Sandor Clegane.¡±
   ¡°How do you like that, dog?¡± King Joffrey asked.
   The Hound¡¯s scarred face was hard to read. He took a long moment to consider. ¡°Why not? I have no lands nor wife to forsake, and who¡¯d care if I did?¡± The burned side of his mouth twisted. ¡°But I warn you, I¡¯ll say no knight¡¯s vows.¡±
   ¡°The Sworn Brothers of the Kingsguard have always been knights,¡± Ser Boros said firmly.
   ¡°Until now,¡± the Hound said in his deep rasp, and Ser Boros fell silent.
   When the king¡¯s herald moved forward, Sansa realized the moment was almost at hand. She smoothed down the cloth of her skirt nervously. She was dressed in mourning, as a sign of respect for the dead king, but she had taken special care to make herself beautiful. Her gown was the ivory silk that the queen had given her, the one Arya had ruined, but she¡¯d had them dye it black and you couldn¡¯t see the stain at all. She had fretted over her jewelry for hours and finally decided upon the elegant simplicity of a plain silver chain.
   The herald¡¯s voice boomed out. ¡°If any man in this hall has other matters to set before His Grace, let him speak now or go forth and hold his silence.¡±
   Sansa quailed. Now, she told herself, I must do it now. Gods give me courage. She took one step, then another. Lords and knights stepped aside silently to let her pass, and she felt the weight of their eyes on her. I must be as strong as my lady mother. ¡°Your Grace,¡± she called out in a soft, tremulous voice.
   The height of the Iron Throne gave Joffrey a better vantage point than anyone else in the hall. He was the first to see her. ¡°Come forward, my lady,¡± he called out, smiling.
   His smile emboldened her, made her feel beautiful and strong. He does love me, he does. Sansa lifted her head and walked toward him, not too slow and not too fast. She must not let them see how nervous she was.
   ¡°The Lady Sansa, of House Stark,¡± the herald cried.
   She stopped under the throne, at the spot where Ser Barristan¡¯s white cloak lay puddled on the floor beside his helm and breastplate. ¡°Do you have some business for king and council, Sansa?¡± the queen asked from the council table.
   ¡°I do.¡± She knelt on the cloak, so as not to spoil her gown, and looked up at her prince on his fearsome black throne. ¡°As it please Your Grace, I ask mercy for my father, Lord Eddard Stark, who was the Hand of the King.¡± She had practiced the words a hundred times.
   The queen sighed. ¡°Sansa, you disappoint me. What did I tell you about traitor¡¯s blood?¡±
   ¡°Your father has committed grave and terrible crimes, my lady,¡± Grand Maester Pycelle intoned.
   ¡°Ah, poor sad thing,¡± sighed Varys. ¡°She is only a babe, my lords, she does not know what she asks.¡±
   Sansa had eyes only for Joffrey. He must listen to me, he must, she thought. The king shifted on his seat, ¡°Let her speak,¡± he commanded. ¡°I want to hear what she says.¡±
   ¡°Thank you, Your Grace.¡± Sansa smiled, a shy secret smile, just for him. He was listening. She knew he would.
   ¡°Treason is a noxious weed,¡± Pycelle declared solemnly. ¡°It must be torn up, root and stem and seed, lest new traitors sprout from every roadside.¡±
   ¡°Do you deny your father¡¯s crime?¡± Lord Baelish asked.
   ¡°No, my lords.¡± Sansa knew better than that. ¡°I know he must be punished. All I ask is mercy. I know my lord father must regret what he did. He was King Robert¡¯s friend and he loved him, you all know he loved him. He never wanted to be Hand until the king asked him. They must have lied to him. Lord Renly or Lord Stannis or?.?.?.?or somebody, they must have lied, otherwise?.?.?.?¡±
   King Joffrey leaned forward, hands grasping the arms of the throne. Broken sword points fanned out between his fingers. ¡°He said I wasn¡¯t the king. Why did he say that?¡±
   ¡°His leg was broken,¡± Sansa replied eagerly. ¡°It hurt ever so much, Maester Pycelle was giving him milk of the poppy, and they say that milk of the poppy fills your head with clouds. Otherwise he would never have said it.¡±
   Varys said, ¡°A child¡¯s faith?.?.?.?such sweet innocence?.?.?.?and yet, they say wisdom oft comes from the mouths of babes.¡±
   ¡°Treason is treason,¡± Pycelle replied at once.
   Joffrey rocked restlessly on the throne. ¡°Mother?¡±
   Cersei Lannister considered Sansa thoughtfully. ¡°If Lord Eddard were to confess his crime,¡± she said at last, ¡°we would know he had repented his folly.¡±
   Joffrey pushed himself to his feet. Please, Sansa thought, please, please, be the king I know you are, good and kind and noble, please. ¡°Do you have any more to say?¡± he asked her.
   ¡°Only?.?.?.?that as you love me, you do me this kindness, my prince,¡± Sansa said.
   King Joffrey looked her up and down. ¡°Your sweet words have moved me,¡± he said gallantly, nodding, as if to say all would be well. ¡°I shall do as you ask?.?.?.?but first your father has to confess. He has to confess and say that I¡¯m the king, or there will be no mercy for him.¡±
   ¡°He will,¡± Sansa said, heart soaring. ¡°Oh, I know he will.¡±
   
   . Once Grand Maester Pycelle came with a box of flasks and bottles, to ask if she was ill. He felt her brow, made her undress, and touched her all over while her bedmaid held her down. When he left he gave her a potion of honeywater and herbs and told her to drink a swallow every night. She drank it all right then and went back to sleep.
   She dreamt of footsteps on the tower stair, an ominous scraping of leather on stone as a man climbed slowly toward her bedchamber, step by step. All she could do was huddle behind her door and listen, trembling, as he came closer and closer. It was Ser Ilyn Payne, she knew, coming for her with Ice in his hand, coming to take her head. There was no place to run, no place to hide, no way to bar the door. Finally the footsteps stopped and she knew he was just outside, standing there silent with his dead eyes and his long pocked face. That was when she realized she was naked. She crouched down, trying to cover herself with her hands, as her door began to swing open, creaking, the point of the greatsword poking through?.?.?.?
   She woke murmuring, ¡°Please, please, I¡¯ll be good, I¡¯ll be good, please don¡¯t,¡± but there was no one to hear.
   When they finally came for her in truth, Sansa never heard their footsteps. It was Joffrey who opened her door, not Ser Ilyn but the boy who had been her prince. She was in bed, curled up tight, her curtains drawn, and she could not have said if it was noon or midnight. The first thing she heard was the slam of the door. Then her bed hangings were yanked back, and she threw up a hand against the sudden light and saw them standing over her.
   ¡°You will attend me in court this afternoon,¡± Joffrey said. ¡°See that you bathe and dress as befits my betrothed.¡± Sandor Clegane stood at his shoulder in a plain brown doublet and green mantle, his burned face hideous in the morning light. Behind them were two knights of the Kingsguard in long white satin cloaks.
   Sansa drew her blanket up to her chin to cover herself. ¡°No,¡± she whimpered, ¡°please?.?.?.?leave me be.¡±
   ¡°If you won¡¯t rise and dress yourself, my Hound will do it for you,¡± Joffrey said.
   ¡°I beg of you, my prince?.?.?.?¡±
   ¡°I¡¯m king now. Dog, get her out of bed.¡±
   Sandor Clegane scooped her up around the waist and lifted her off the featherbed as she struggled feebly. Her blanket fell to the floor. Underneath she had only a thin bedgown to cover her nakedness. ¡°Do as you¡¯re bid, child,¡± Clegane said. ¡°Dress.¡± He pushed her toward her wardrobe, almost gently.
   Sansa backed away from them. ¡°I did as the queen asked, I wrote the letters, I wrote what she told me. You promised you¡¯d be merciful. Please, let me go home. I won¡¯t do any treason, I¡¯ll be good, I swear it, I don¡¯t have traitor¡¯s blood, I don¡¯t. I only want to go home.¡± Remembering her courtesies, she lowered her head. ¡°As it please you,¡± she finished weakly.
   ¡°It does not please me,¡± Joffrey said. ¡°Mother says I¡¯m still to marry you, so you¡¯ll stay here, and you¡¯ll obey.¡±
aste of battle. He loved his brother, but he would not have wanted to be with him in the Whispering Wood for all the gold in Casterly Rock.
   His lord father¡¯s assembled captains and bannermen had fallen very quiet as the courier told his tale. The only sound was the crackle and hiss of the log burning in the hearth at the end of the long, drafty common room.
   After the hardships of the long relentless drive south, the prospect of even a single night in an inn had cheered Tyrion mightily?.?.?.?though he rather wished it had not been this inn again, with all its memories. His father had set a grueling pace, and it had taken its toll. Men wounded in the battle kept up as best they could or were abandoned to fend for themselves. Every morning they left a few more by the roadside, men who went to sleep never to wake. Every afternoon a few more collapsed along the way. And every evening a few more deserted, stealing off into the dusk. Tyrion had been half-tempted to go with them.
   He had been upstairs, enjoying the comfort of a featherbed and the warmth of Shae¡¯s body beside him, when his squire had woken him to say that a rider had arrived with dire news of Riverrun. So it had all been for nothing. The rush south, the endless forced marches, the bodies left beside the road?.?.?.?all for naught. Robb Stark had reached Riverrun days and days ago.
   ¡°How could this happen?¡± Ser Harys Swyft moaned. ¡°How? Even after the Whispering Wood, you had Riverrun ringed in iron, surrounded by a great host?.?.?.?what madness made Ser Jaime decide to split his men into three separate camps? Surely he knew how vulnerable that would leave them?¡±
   Better than you, you chinless craven, Tyrion thought. Jaime might have lost Riverrun, but it angered him to hear his brother slandered by the likes of Swyft, a shameless lickspittle whose greatest accomplishment was marrying his equally chinless daughter to Ser Kevan, and thereby attaching himself to the Lannisters.
   ¡°I would have done the same,¡± his uncle responded, a good deal more calmly than Tyrion might have. ¡°You have never seen Riverrun, Ser Harys, or you would know that Jaime had little choice in the matter. The castle is situated at the end of the point of land where the Tumblestone flows into the Red Fork of the Trident. The rivers form two sides of a triangle, and when danger threatens, the Tullys open their sluice gates upstream to create a wide moat on the third side, turning Riverrun into an island. The walls rise sheer from the water, and from their towers the defenders have a commanding view of the opposite shores for many leagues around. To cut off all the approaches, a besieger must needs place one camp north of the Tumblestone, one south of the Red Fork, and a third between the rivers, west of the moat. There is no other way, none.¡±
   ¡°Ser Kevan speaks truly, my lords,¡± the courier said. ¡°We¡¯d built palisades of sharpened stakes around the camps, yet it was not enough, not with no warning and the rivers cutting us off from each other. They came down on the north camp first. No one was expecting an attack. Marq Piper had been raiding our supply trains, but he had no more than fifty men. Ser Jaime had gone out to deal with them the night before?.?.?.?well, with what we thought was them. We were told the Stark host was east of the Green Fork, marching south?.?.?.?¡±
   ¡°And your outriders?¡± Ser Gregor Clegane¡¯s face might have been hewn from rock. The fire in the hearth gave a somber orange cast to his skin and put deep shadows in the hollows of his eyes. ¡°They saw nothing? They gave you no warning?¡±
   The bloodstained messenger shook his head. ¡°Our outriders had been vanishing. Marq Piper¡¯s work, we thought. The ones who did come back had seen nothing.¡±
   ¡°A man who sees nothing has no use for his eyes,¡± the Mountain declared. ¡°Cut them out and give them to your next outrider. Tell him you hope that four eyes might see better than two?.?.?.?and if not, the man after him will have six.¡±
   Lord Tywin Lannister turned his face to study Ser Gregor. Tyrion saw a glimmer of gold as the light shone off his father¡¯s pupils, but he could not have said whether the look was one of approval or disgust. Lord Tywin was oft quiet in council, preferring to listen before he spoke, a habit Tyrion himself tried to emulate. Yet this silence was uncharacteristic even for him, and his wine was untouched.
   ¡°You said they came at night,¡± Ser Kevan prompted.
   The man gave a weary nod. ¡°The Blackfish led the van, cutting down our sentries and clearing away the palisades for the main assault. By the time our men knew what was happening, riders were pouring over the ditch banks and galloping through the camp with swords and torches in hand. I was sleeping in the west camp, between the rivers. When we heard the fighting and saw the tents being fired, Lord Brax led us to the rafts and we tried to pole across, but the current pushed us downstream and the Tullys started flinging rocks at us with the catapults on their walls. I saw one raft smashed to kindling and three others overturned, men swept into the river and drowned?.?.?.?and those who did make it across found the Starks waiting for them on the riverbanks.¡±
   Ser Flement Brax wore a silver-and-purple tabard and the look of a man who cannot comprehend what he has just heard. ¡°My lord father...¡±
   ¡°Sorry, my lord,¡± the messenger said. ¡°Lord Brax was clad in plate-and-mail when his raft overturned. He was very gallant.¡±
   He was a fool, Tyrion thought, swirling his cup and staring down into the winy depths. Crossing a river at night on a crude raft, wearing armor, with an enemy waiting on the other side, if that was gallantry, he would take cowardice every time. He wondered if Lord Brax had felt especially gallant as the weight of his steel pulled him under the black water.
   ¡°The camp between the rivers was overrun as well,¡± the messenger was saying. ¡°While we were trying to cross, more Starks swept in from the west, two columns of armored horse. I saw Lord Umber¡¯s giant-in-chains and the Mallister eagle, but it was the boy who led them, with a monstrous wolf running at his side. I wasn¡¯t there to see, but it¡¯s said the beast killed four men and ripped apart a dozen horses. Our spearmen formed up a shieldwall and held against their first charge, but when the Tullys saw them engaged, they opened the gates of Riverrun and Tytos Blackwood led a sortie across the drawbridge and took them in the rear.¡±
   ¡°Gods save us,¡± Lord Lefford swore.
   ¡°Greatjon Umber fired the siege towers we were building, and Lord Blackwood found Ser Edmure Tully in chains among the other captives, and made off with them all. Our south camp was under the command of Ser Forley Prester. He retreated in good order when he saw that the other camps were lost, with two thousand spears and as many bowmen, but the Tyroshi sellsword who led his freeriders struck his banners and went over to the foe.¡±
   ¡°Curse the man.¡± His uncle Kevan sounded more angry than surprised. ¡°I warned Jaime not to trust that one. A man who fights for coin is loyal only to his purse.¡±
   Lord Tywin wove his fingers together under his chin. Only his eyes moved as he listened. His bristling golden side-whiskers framed a face so still it might have been a mask, but Tyrion could see tiny beads of sweat dappling his father¡¯s shaven head.
   ¡°How could it happen?¡± Ser Harys Swyft wailed again. ¡°Ser Jaime taken, the siege broken?.?.?.?this is a catastrophe!¡±
   Ser Addam Marbrand said, ¡°I am sure we are all grateful to you for pointing out the obvious, Ser Harys. The question is, what shall we do about it?¡±
   ¡°What can we do? Jaime¡¯s host is all slaughtered or taken or put to flight, and the Starks and the Tullys sit squarely across our line of supply. We are cut off from the west! They can march on Casterly Rock if they so choose, and what¡¯s to stop them? My lords, we are beaten. We must sue for peace.¡±
   ¡°Peace?¡± Tyrion swirled his wine thoughtfully, took a deep draft, and hurled his empty cup to the floor, where it shattered into a thousand pieces. ¡°There¡¯s your peace, Ser Harys. My sweet nephew broke it for good and all when he decided to ornament the Red Keep with Lord Eddard¡¯s head. You¡¯ll have an easier time drinking wine from that cup than you will convincing Robb Stark to make peace now. He¡¯s winning?.?.?.?or hadn¡¯t you noticed?¡±
   ¡°Two battles do not make a war,¡± Ser Addam insisted. ¡°We are far from lost. I should welcome the chance to try my own steel against this Stark boy.¡±
   ¡°Perhaps they would consent to a truce, and allow us to trade our prisoners for theirs,¡± offered Lord Lefford.
   ¡°Unless they trade three-for-one, we still come out light on those scales,¡± Tyrion said acidly. ¡°And what are we to offer for my brother? Lord Eddard¡¯s rotting head?¡±
   ¡°I had heard that Queen Cersei has the Hand¡¯s daughters,¡± Lefford said hopefully. ¡°If we give the lad his sisters back?.?.?.?¡±
   Ser Addam snorted disdainfully. ¡°He would have to be an utter ass to trade Jaime Lannister¡¯s life for two girls.¡±
   ¡°Then we must ransom Ser Jaime, whatever it costs,¡± Lord Lefford said.
   Tyrion rolled his eyes. ¡°If the Starks feel the need for gold, they can melt down Jaime¡¯s armor.¡±
   ¡°if we ask for a truce, they will think us weak,¡± Ser Addarn argued. ¡°We should march on them at once.¡±
   ¡°Surely our friends at court could be prevailed upon to join us with fresh troops,¡± said Ser Harys. ¡°And someone might return to Casterly Rock to raise a new host.¡±
   Lord Tywin Lannister rose to his feet. ¡°They have my son,¡± he said once more, in a voice that cut through the babble like a sword through suet. ¡°Leave me. All of you.¡±
   Ever the soul of obedience, Tyrion rose to depart with the rest, but his father gave him a look. ¡°Not you, Tyrion. Remain. And you as well, Kevan. The rest of you, out.¡±
   Tyrion eased himself back onto the bench, startled into speechlessness. Ser Kevan crossed the room to the wine casks. ¡°Uncle,¡± Tyrion called, ¡°if you would be so kind...¡±
   ¡°Here.¡± His father offered him his cup, the wine untouched.
   Now Tyrion truly was nonplussed. He drank.
   Lord Tywin seated himself. ¡°You have the right of it about Stark. Alive, we might have used Lord Eddard to forge a peace with Winterfell and Riverrun, a peace that would have given us the time we need to deal with Robert¡¯s brothers. Dead?.?.?.?¡± His hand curled into a fist. ¡°Madness. Rank madness.¡±
   ¡°Joff¡¯s only a boy,¡± Tyrion pointed out. ¡°At his age, I committed a few follies of my own.¡±
   His father gave him a sharp look. ¡°I suppose we ought to be grateful that he has not yet married a whore.¡±
   Tyrion sipped at his wine, wondering how Lord Tywin would look if he flung the cup in his face.
   ¡°Our position is worse than you know,¡± his father went on. ¡°It would seem we have a new king.¡±
   Ser Kevan looked poleaxed. ¡°A new, who? What have they done to Joffrey?¡±
   The faintest flicker of distaste played across Lord Tywin¡¯s thin lips. ¡°Nothing?.?.?.?yet. My grandson still sits the Iron Throne, but the eunuch has heard whispers from the south. Renly Baratheon wed Margaery Tyrell at Highgarden this fortnight past, and now he has claimed the crown. The bride¡¯s father and brothers have bent the knee and sworn him their swords.¡±
   ¡°Those are grave tidings.¡± When Ser Kevan frowned, the furrows in his brow grew deep as canyons.
   ¡°My daughter commands us to ride for King¡¯s Landing at once, to defend the Red Keep against King Renly and the Knight of Flowers.¡± His mouth tightened. ¡°Commands us, mind you. In the name of the king and council.¡±
   ¡°How is King Joffrey taking the news?¡± Tyrion asked with a certain black amusement.
   ¡°Cersei has not seen fit to tell him yet,¡± Lord Tywin said. ¡°She fears he might insist on marching against Renly himself.¡±
   ¡°With what army?¡± Tyrion asked. ¡°You don¡¯t plan to give him this one, I hope?¡±
   ¡°He talks of leading the City Watch,¡± Lord Tywin said.
   ¡°If he takes the Watch, he¡¯ll leave the city undefended,¡± Ser Kevan said. ¡°And with Lord Stannis on Dragonstone?.?.?.?¡±
   ¡°Yes.¡± Lord Tywin looked down at his son. ¡°I had thought you were the one made for motley, Tyrion, but it would appear that I was wrong.¡±
   ¡°Why, Father,¡± said Tyrion, ¡°that almost sounds like praise.¡± He leaned forward intently. ¡°What of Stannis? He¡¯s the elder, not Renly. How does he feel about his brother¡¯s claim?¡±
   His father frowned. ¡°I have felt from the beginning that Stannis was a greater danger than all the others combined. Yet he does nothing. Oh, Varys hears his whispers. Stannis is building ships, Stannis is hiring sellswords, Stannis is bringing a shadowbinder from Asshai. What does it mean? Is any of it true?¡± He gave an irritated shrug. ¡°Kevan, bring us the map.¡±
   Ser Kevan did as he was bid. Lord Tywin unrolled the leather, smoothing it flat. ¡°Jaime has left us in a bad way. Roose Bolton and the remnants of his host are north of us. Our enemies hold the Twins and Moat Cailin. Robb Stark sits to the west, so we cannot retreat to Lannisport and the Rock unless we choose to give battle. Jaime is taken, and his army for all purposes has ceased to exist. Thoros of Myr and Beric Dondarrion continue to plague our foraging parties. To our east we have the Arryns, Stannis Baratheon sits on Dragonstone, and in the south Highgarden and Storm¡¯s End are calling their banners.¡±
   Tyrion smiled crookedly. ¡°Take heart, Father. At least Rhaegar Targaryen is still dead.¡±
   ¡°I had hoped you might have more to offer us than japes, Tyrion,¡± Lord Tywin Lannister said.
   Ser Kevan frowned over the map, forehead creasing. ¡°Robb Stark will have Edmure Tully and the lords of the Trident with him now. Their combined power may exceed our own. And with Roose Bolton behind us?.?.?.?Tywin, if we remain here, I fear we might be caught between three armies.¡±
   ¡°I have no intention of remaining here. We must finish our business with young Lord Stark before Renly Baratheon can march from Highgarden. Bolton does not concern me. He is a wary man, and we made him warier on the Green Fork. He will be slow to give pursuit. So?.?.?.?on the morrow, we make for Harrenhal. Kevan, I want Ser Addam¡¯s outriders to screen our movements. Give him as many men as he requires, and send them out in groups of four. I will have no vanishings.¡±
   ¡°As you say, my lord, but?.?.?.?why Harrenhal? That is a grim, unlucky place. Some call it cursed.¡±
   ¡°Let them,¡± Lord Tywin said. ¡°Unleash Ser Gregor and send him before us with his reavers. Send forth Vargo Hoat and his freeriders as well, and Ser Amory Lorch. Each is to have three hundred horse. Tell them I want to see the riverlands afire from the Gods Eye to the Red Fork.¡±
   ¡°They will burn, my lord,¡± Ser Kevan said, rising. ¡°I shall give the commands.¡± He bowed and made for the door.
   When they were alone, Lord Tywin glanced at Tyrion. ¡°Your savages might relish a bit of rapine. Tell them they may ride with Vargo Hoat and plunder as they like, goods, stock, women, they may take what they want and burn the rest.¡±
   ¡°Telling Shagga and Timett how to pillage is like telling a rooster how to crow,¡± Tyrion commented, ¡°but I should prefer to keep them with me.¡± Uncouth and unruly they might be, yet the wildlings were his, and he trusted them more than any of his father¡¯s men. He was not about to hand them over.
   ¡°Then you had best learn to control them. I will not have the city plundered.¡±
   ¡°The city?¡± Tyrion was lost. ¡°What city would that be?¡±
   ¡°King¡¯s Landing. I am sending you to court.¡±
   It was the last thing Tyrion Lannister would ever have anticipated.
   He reached for his wine, and considered for a moment as he sipped. ¡°And what am I to do there?¡±
   ¡°Rule,¡± his father said curtly.
   Tyrion hooted with laughter. ¡°My sweet sister might have a word or two to say about that!¡±
   ¡°Let her say what she likes. Her son needs to be taken in hand before he ruins us all. I blame those jackanapes on the council, our friend Petyr, the venerable Grand Maester, and that cockless wonder Lord Varys. What sort of counsel are they giving Joffrey when he lurches from one folly to the next? Whose notion was it to make this Janos Slynt a lord? The man¡¯s father was a butcher, and they grant him Harrenhal. Harrenhal, that was the seat of kings! Not that he will ever set foot inside it, if I have a say. I am told he took a bloody spear for his sigil. A bloody cleaver would have been my choice.¡± His father had not raised his voice, yet Tyrion could see the anger in the gold of his eyes. ¡°And dismissing Selmy, where was the sense in that? Yes, the man was old, but the name of Barristan the Bold still has meaning in the realm. He lent honor to any man he served. Can anyone say the same of the Hound? You feed your dog bones under the table, you do not seat him beside you on the high bench.¡± He pointed a finger at Tyrion¡¯s face. ¡°If Cersei cannot curb the boy, you must. And if these councillors are playing us false?.?.?.?¡±
   Tyrion knew. ¡°Spikes,¡± he sighed. ¡°Heads. Walls.¡±
   ¡°I see you have taken a few lessons from me.¡±
   ¡°More than you know, Father,¡± Tyrion answered quietly. He finished his wine and set the cup aside, thoughtful. A part of him was more pleased than he cared to admit. Another part was remembering the battle upriver, and wondering if he was being sent to hold the left again. ¡°Why me?¡± he asked, cocking his head to one side. ¡°Why not my uncle? Why not Ser Addam or Ser Flement or Lord Serrett? Why not a?.?.?.?bigger man?¡±
   Lord Tywin rose abruptly. ¡°You are my son.¡±
   That was when he knew. You have given him up for lost, he thought. You bloody bastard, you think Jaime¡¯s good as dead, so I¡¯m all you have left. Tyrion wanted to slap him, to spit in his face, to draw his dagger and cut the heart out of him and see if it was made of old hard gold, the way the smallfolks said. Yet he sat there, silent and still.
   The shards of the broken cup crunched beneath his father¡¯s heels as Lord Tywin crossed the room. ¡°One last thing,¡± he said at the door. ¡°You will not take the whore to court.¡±
   Tyrion sat alone in the common room for a long while after his father was gone. Finally he climbed the steps to his cozy garret beneath the bell tower. The ceiling was low, but that was scarcely a drawback for a dwarf. From the window, he could see the gibbet his father had erected in the yard. The innkeep¡¯s body turned slowly on its rope whenever the night wind gusted. Her flesh had grown as thin and ragged as Lannister hopes.
   Shae murmured sleepily and rolled toward him when he sat on the edge of the featherbed. He slid his hand under the blanket and cupped a soft breast, and her eyes opened. ¡°M¡¯lord,¡± she said with a drowsy smile.
   When he felt her nipple stiffen, Tyrion kissed her. ¡°I have a mind to take you to King¡¯s Landing, sweetling,¡± he whispered.
   
   JON
   The mare whickered softly as Jon Snow tightened the cinch. ¡°Easy, sweet lady,¡± he said in a soft voice, quieting her with a touch. Wind whispered through the stable, a cold dead breath on his face, but Jon paid it no mind. He strapped his roll to the saddle, his scarred fingers stiff and clumsy. ¡°Ghost,¡± he called softly, ¡°to me.¡± And the wolf was there, eyes like embers.
   ¡°Jon, please. You must not do this.¡±
   He mounted, the reins in his hand, and wheeled the horse around to face the night. Samwell Tarly stood in the stable door, a full moon peering over his shoulder. He threw a giant¡¯s shadow, immense and black. ¡°Get out of my way, Sam.¡±
   ¡°Jon, you can¡¯t,¡± Sam said. ¡°I won¡¯t let you.¡±
   ¡°I would sooner not hurt you,¡± Jon told him. ¡°Move aside, Sam, or I¡¯ll ride you down.¡±
   ¡°You won¡¯t. You have to listen to me. Please?.?.?.?¡±
   Jon put his spurs to horseflesh, and the mare bolted for the door. For an instant Sam stood his ground, his face as round and pale as the moon behind him, his mouth a widening O of surprise. At the last moment, when they were almost on him, he jumped aside as Jon had known he would, stumbled, and fell. The mare leapt over him, out into the night.
   Jon raised the hood of his heavy cloak and gave the horse her head. Castle Black was silent and still as he rode out, with Ghost racing at his side. Men watched from the Wall behind him, he knew, but their eyes were turned north, not south. No one would see him go, no one but Sam Tarly, struggling back to his feet in the dust of the old stables. He hoped Sam hadn¡¯t hurt himself, falling like that. He was so heavy and so ungainly, it would be just like him to break a wrist or twist his ankle getting out of the way. ¡°I warned him,¡± Jon said aloud. ¡°It was nothing to do with him, anyway.¡± He flexed his burned hand as he rode, opening and closing the scarred fingers. They still pained him, but it felt good to have the wrappings off.
   Moonlight silvered the hills as he followed the twisting ribbon of the kingsroad. He needed to get as far from the Wall as he could before they realized he was gone. On the morrow he would leave the road and strike out overland through field and bush and stream to throw off pursuit, but for the moment speed was more important than deception. It was not as though they would not guess where he was going.
   The Old Bear was accustomed to rise at first light, so Jon had until dawn to put as many leagues as he could between him and the Wall?.?.?.?if Sam Tarly did not betray him. The fat boy was dutiful and easily frightened, but he loved Jon like a brother. If questioned, Sam would doubtless tell them the truth, but Jon could not imagine him braving the guards in front of the King¡¯s Tower to wake Mormont from sleep.
   When Jon did not appear to fetch the Old Bear¡¯s breakfast from the kitchen, they¡¯d look in his cell and find Longclaw on the bed. It had been hard to abandon it, but Jon was not so lost to honor as to take it with him. Even Jorah Mormont had not done that, when he fled in disgrace. Doubtless Lord Mormont would find someone more worthy of the blade. Jon felt bad when he thought of the old man. He knew his desertion would be salt in the still-raw wound of his son¡¯s disgrace. That seemed a poor way to repay him for his trust, but it couldn¡¯t be helped. No matter what he did, Jon felt as though he were betraying someone.
   Even now, he did not know if he was doing the honorable thing. The southron had it easier. They had their septons to talk to, someone to tell them the gods¡¯ will and help sort out right from wrong. But the Starks worshiped the old gods, the nameless gods, and if the heart trees heard, they did not speak.
   When the last lights of Castle Black vanished behind him, Jon slowed his mare to a walk. He had a long journey ahead and only the one horse to see him through. There were holdfasts and farming villages along the road south where he might be able to trade the mare for a fresh mount when he needed one, but not if she were injured or blown.
   He would need to find new clothes soon; most like, he¡¯d need to steal them. He was clad in black from head to heel; high leather riding boots, roughspun breeches and tunic, sleeveless leather jerkin, and heavy wool cloak. His longsword and dagger were sheathed in black moleskin, and the hauberk and coif in his saddlebag were black ringmail. Any bit of it could mean his death if he were taken. A stranger wearing black was viewed with cold suspicion in every village and holdfast north of the Neck, and men would soon be watching for him. Once Maester Aemon¡¯s ravens took flight, Jon knew he would find no safe haven. Not even at Winterfell. Bran might want to let him in, but Maester Luwin had better sense. He would bar the gates and send Jon away, as he should. Better not to call there at all.
   Yet he saw the castle clear in his mind¡¯s eye, as if he had left it only yesterday; the towering granite walls, the Great Hall with its smells of smoke and dog and roasting meat, his father¡¯s solar, the turret room where he had slept. Part of him wanted nothing so much as to hear Bran laugh again, to sup on one of Gage¡¯s beef-and-bacon pies, to listen to Old Nan tell her tales of the children of the forest and Florian the Fool.
   But he had not left the Wall for that; he had left because he was after all his father¡¯s son, and Robb¡¯s brother. The gift of a sword, even a sword as fine as Longclaw, did not make him a Mormont. Nor was he Aemon Targaryen. Three times the old man had chosen, and three times he had chosen honor, but that was him. Even now, Jon could not decide whether the maester had stayed because he was weak and craven, or because he was strong and true. Yet he understood what the old man had meant, about the pain of choosing; he understood that all too well.
   Tyrion Lannister had claimed that most men would rather deny a hard truth than face it, but Jon was done with denials. He was who he was; Jon Snow, bastard and oathbreaker, motherless, friendless, and damned. For the rest of his life, however long that might be, he would be condemned to be an outsider, the silent man standing in the shadows who dares not speak his true name. Wherever he might go throughout the Seven Kingdoms, he would need to live a lie, lest every man¡¯s hand be raised against him. But it made no matter, so long as he lived long enough to take his place by his brother¡¯s side and help avenge his father.
   He remembered Robb as he had last seen him, standing in the yard with snow melting in his auburn hair. Jon would have to come to him in secret, disguised. He tried to imagine the look on Robb¡¯s face when he revealed himself. His brother would shake his head and smile, and he¡¯d say?.?.?.?he¡¯d say?.?.?.?
   He could not see the smile. Hard as he tried, he could not see it. He found himself thinking of the deserter his father had beheaded the day they¡¯d found the direwolves. ¡°You said the words,¡± Lord Eddard had told him. ¡°You took a vow, before your brothers, before the old gods and the new.¡± Desmond and Fat Tom had dragged the man to the stump. Bran¡¯s eyes had been wide as saucers, and Jon had to remind him to keep his pony in hand. He remembered the look on Father¡¯s face when Theon Greyjoy brought forth Ice, the spray of blood on the snow, the way Theon had kicked the head when it came rolling at his feet.
   He wondered what Lord Eddard might have done if the deserter had been his brother Benjen instead of that ragged stranger. Would it have been any different? It must, surely, surely?.?.?.?and Robb would welcome him, for a certainty. He had to, or else?.?.?.?
   It did not bear thinking about. Pain throbbed, deep in his fingers, as he clutched the reins. Jon put his heels into his horse and broke into a gallop, racing down the kingsroad, as if to outrun his doubts. Jon was not afraid of death, but he did not want to die like that, trussed and bound and beheaded like a common brigand. If he must perish, let it be with a sword in his hand, fighting his father¡¯s killers. He was no true Stark, had never been one?.?.?.?but he could die like one. Let them say that Eddard Stark had fathered four sons, not three.
   Ghost kept pace with them for almost half a mile, red tongue lolling from his mouth. Man and horse alike lowered their heads as he asked the mare for more speed. The wolf slowed, stopped, watching, his eyes glowing red in the moonlight. He vanished behind, but Jon knew he would follow, at his own pace.
   Scattered lights flickered through the trees ahead of him, on both sides of the road: Mole¡¯s Town. A dog barked as he rode through, and he heard a mule¡¯s raucous haw from the stable, but otherwise the village was still. Here and there the glow of hearth fires shone through shuttered windows, leaking between wooden slats, but only a few.
   Mole¡¯s Town was bigger than it seemed, but three quarters of it was under the ground, in deep warm cellars connected by a maze of tunnels. Even the whorehouse was down there, nothing on the surface but a wooden shack no bigger than a privy, with a red lantern hung over the door. On the Wall, he¡¯d heard men call the whores ¡°buried treasures.¡± He wondered whether any of his brothers in black were down there tonight, mining. That was oathbreaking too, yet no one seemed to care.
   Not until he was well beyond the village did Jon slow again. By then both he and the mare were damp with sweat. He dismounted, shivering, his burned hand aching. A bank of melting snow lay under the trees, bright in the moonlight, water trickling off to form small shallow pools. Jon squatted and brought his hands together, cupping the runoff between his fingers. The snowmelt was icy cold. He drank, and splashed some on his face, until his cheeks tingled. His fingers were throbbing worse than they had in days, and his head was pounding too. I am doing the right thing, he told himself, so why do I feel so bad?
   The horse was well lathered, so Jon took the lead and walked her for a while. The road was scarcely wide enough for two riders to pass abreast, its surface cut by tiny streams and littered with stone. That run had been truly stupid, an invitation to a broken neck. Jon wondered what had gotten into him. Was he in such a great rush to die?
   Off in the trees, the distant scream of some frightened animal made him look up. His mare whinnied nervously. Had his wolf found some prey? He cupped his hands around his mouth. ¡°Ghost!¡± he shouted. ¡°Ghost, to me.¡± The only answer was a rush of wings behind him as an owl took flight.
   Frowning, Jon continued on his way. He led the mare for half an hour, until she was dry. Ghost did not appear. Jon wanted to mount up and ride again, but he was concerned about his missing wolf. ¡°Ghost,¡± he called again. ¡°Where are you? To me! Ghost!¡± Nothing in these woods could trouble a direwolf, even a half-grown direwolf, unless?.?.?.?no, Ghost was too smart to attack a bear, and if there was a wolf pack anywhere close Jon would have surely heard them howling.
   He should eat, he decided. Food would settle his stomach and give Ghost the chance to catch up. There was no danger yet; Castle Black still slept. In his saddlebag, he found a biscuit, a piece of cheese, and a small withered brown apple. He¡¯d brought salt beef as well, and a rasher of bacon he¡¯d filched from the kitchens, but he would save the meat for the morrow. After it was gone he¡¯d need to hunt, and that would slow him.
   Jon sat under the trees and ate his biscuit and cheese while his mare grazed along the kingsroad. He kept the apple for last. It had gone a little soft, but the flesh was still tart and juicy. He was down to the core when he heard the sounds: horses, and from the north. Quickly Jon leapt up and strode to his mare. Could he outrun them? No, they were too close, they¡¯d hear him for a certainty, and if they were from Castle Black?.?.?.?
   He led the mare off the road, behind a thick stand of grey-green sentinels. ¡°Ouiet now,¡± he said in a hushed voice, crouching down to peer through the branches. If the gods were kind, the riders would pass by. Likely as not, they were only smallfolk from Mole¡¯s Town, farmers on their way to their fields, although what they were doing out in the middle of the night?.?.?.?
   He listened to the sound of hooves growing steadily louder as they trotted briskly down the kingsroad. From the sound, there were five or six of them at the least. Their voices drifted through the trees.
   ¡°?.?.?.?certain he came this way?¡±
   ¡°We can¡¯t be certain.¡±
   ¡°He could have ridden east, for all you know. Or left the road to cut through the woods. That¡¯s what I¡¯d do.¡±
   ¡°In the dark? Stupid. If you didn¡¯t fall off your horse and break your neck, you¡¯d get lost and wind up back at the Wall when the sun came up.¡±
   ¡°I would not.¡± Grenn sounded peeved. ¡°I¡¯d just ride south, you can tell south by the stars.¡±
   ¡°What if the sky was cloudy?¡± Pyp asked.
   ¡°Then I wouldn¡¯t go.¡±
   Another voice broke in. ¡°You know where I¡¯d be if it was me? I¡¯d be in Mole¡¯s Town, digging for buried treasure.¡± Toad¡¯s shrill laughter boomed through the trees. Jon¡¯s mare snorted.
   ¡°Keep quiet, all of you,¡± Haider said. ¡°I thought I heard something.¡±
   ¡°Where? I didn¡¯t hear anything.¡± The horses stopped.
   ¡°You can¡¯t hear yourself fart.¡±
   ¡°I can too,¡± Grenn insisted.
   ¡°Quiet!¡±
   They all fell silent, listening. Jon found himself holding his breath. Sam, he thought. He hadn¡¯t gone to the Old Bear, but he hadn¡¯t gone to bed either, he¡¯d woken the other boys. Damn them all. Come dawn, if they were not in their beds, they¡¯d be named deserters too. What did they think they were doing?
   The hushed silence seemed to stretch on and on. From where Jon crouched, he could see the legs of their horses through the branches. Finally Pyp spoke up. ¡°What did you hear?¡±
   ¡°I don¡¯t know,¡± Haider admitted. ¡°A sound, I thought it might have been a horse but?.?.?.?¡±
   ¡°There¡¯s nothing here.¡±
   Out of the corner of his eye, Jon glimpsed a pale shape moving through the trees. Leaves rustled, and Ghost came bounding out of the shadows, so suddenly that Jon¡¯s mare started and gave a whinny. ¡°There!¡± Halder shouted.
   ¡°I heard it too!¡±
   ¡°Traitor,¡± Jon told the direwolf as he swung up into the saddle. He turned the mare¡¯s head to slide off through the trees, but they were on him before he had gone ten feet.
   ¡°Jon!¡± Pyp shouted after him.
   ¡°Pull up,¡± Grenn said. ¡°You can¡¯t outrun us all.¡±
   Jon wheeled around to face them, drawing his sword. ¡°Get back. I don¡¯t wish to hurt you, but I will if I have to.¡±
   ¡°One against seven?¡± Halder gave a signal. The boys spread out, surrounding him.
   ¡°What do you want with me?¡± Jon demanded.
   ¡°We want to take you back where you belong,¡± Pyp said.
   ¡°I belong with my brother.¡±
   ¡°We¡¯re your brothers now,¡± Grenn said.
   ¡°They¡¯ll cut off your head if they catch you, you know,¡± Toad put in with a nervous laugh. ¡°This is so stupid, it¡¯s like something the Aurochs would do.¡±
   ¡°I would not,¡± Grenn said. ¡°I¡¯m no oathbreaker. I said the words and I meant them.¡±
   ¡°So did I,¡± Jon told them. ¡°Don¡¯t you understand? They murdered my father. It¡¯s war, my brother Robb is fighting in the riverlands...¡±
   ¡°We know,¡± said Pyp solemnly. ¡°Sam told us everything.¡±
   ¡°We¡¯re sorry about your father,¡± Grenn said, ¡°but it doesn¡¯t matter. Once you say the words, you can¡¯t leave, no matter what.¡±
   ¡°I have to,¡± Jon said fervently.
   ¡°You said the words,¡± Pyp reminded him. ¡°Now my watch begins, you said it. It shall not end until my death.¡±
   ¡°I shall live and die at my post,¡± Grenn added, nodding.
   ¡°You don¡¯t have to tell me the words, I know them as well as you do.¡± He was angry now. Why couldn¡¯t they let him go in peace? They were only making it harder.
   ¡°I am the sword in the darkness,¡± Halder intoned.
   ¡°The watcher on the walls,¡± piped Toad.
   Jon cursed them all to their faces. They took no notice. Pyp spurred his horse closer, reciting, ¡°I am the fire that burns against the cold, the light that brings the dawn, the horn that wakes the sleepers, the shield that guards the realms of men.¡±
   ¡°Stay back,¡± Jon warned him, brandishing his sword. ¡°I mean it, Pyp.¡± They weren¡¯t even wearing armor, he could cut them to pieces if he had to.
   Matthar had circled behind him. He joined the chorus. ¡°I pledge my life and honor to the Night¡¯s Watch.¡±
   Jon kicked his mare, spinning her in a circle. The boys were all around him now, closing from every side.
   ¡°For this night?.?.?.?¡± Halder trotted in from the left.
   ¡°?.?.?.?and all the nights to come,¡± finished Pyp. He reached over for Jon¡¯s reins. ¡°So here are your choices. Kill me, or come back with me.¡±
   Jon lifted his sword?.?.?.?and lowered it, helpless. ¡°Damn you,¡± he said. ¡°Damn you all.¡±
   ¡°Do we have to bind your hands, or will you give us your word you¡¯ll ride back peaceful?¡± asked Halder.
   ¡°I won¡¯t run, if that¡¯s what you mean.¡± Ghost moved out from under the trees and Jon glared at him. ¡°Small help you were,¡± he said. The deep red eyes looked at him knowingly.
   ¡°We had best hurry,¡± Pyp said. ¡°If we¡¯re not back before first light, the Old Bear will have all our heads.¡±
   Of the ride back, Jon Snow remembered little. It seemed shorter than the journey south, perhaps because his mind was elsewhere. Pyp set the pace, galloping, walking, trotting, and then breaking into another gallop. Mole¡¯s Town came and went, the red lantern over the brothel long extinguished. They made good time. Dawn was still an hour off when Jon glimpsed the towers of Castle Black ahead of them, dark against the pale immensity of the Wall. It did not seem like home this time.
   They could take him back, Jon told himself, but they could not make him stay. The war would not end on the morrow, or the day after, and his friends could not watch him day and night. He would bide his time, make them think he was content to remain here?.?.?.?and then, when they had grown lax, he would be off again. Next time he would avoid the kingsroad. He could follow the Wall east, perhaps all the way to the sea, a longer route but a safer one. Or even west, to the mountains, and then south over the high passes. That was the wildling¡¯s way, hard and perilous, but at least no one wouid follow him. He wouldn¡¯t stray within a hundred leagues of Winterfell or the kingsroad.
   Samwell Tarly awaited them in the old stables, slumped on the ground against a bale of hay, too anxious to sleep. He rose and brushed himself off. ¡°I?.?.?.?I¡¯m glad they found you, Jon.¡±
   ¡°I¡¯m not,¡± Jon said, dismounting.
   Pyp hopped off his horse and looked at the lightening sky with disgust. ¡°Give us a hand bedding down the horses, Sam,¡± the small boy said. ¡°We have a long day before us, and no sleep to face it on, thanks to Lord Snow.¡±
   When day broke, Jon walked to the kitchens as he did every dawn. Three-Finger Hobb said nothing as he gave him the Old Bear¡¯s breakfast. Today it was three brown eggs boiled hard, with fried bread and ham steak and a bowl of wrinkled plums. Jon carried the food back to the King¡¯s Tower. He found Mormont at the window seat, writing. His raven was walking back and forth across his shoulders, muttering, ¡°Corn, corn, corn.¡± The bird shrieked when Jon entered. ¡°Put the food on the table,¡± the Old Bear said, glancing up. ¡°I¡¯ll have some beer.¡±
   Jon opened a shuttered window, took the flagon of beer off the outside ledge, and filled a horn. Hobb had given him a lemon, still cold from the Wall. Jon crushed it in his fist. The juice trickled through his fingers. Mormont drank lemon in his beer every day, and claimed that was why he still had his own teeth.
   ¡°Doubtless you loved your father,¡± Mormont said when Jon brought him his horn. ¡°The things we love destroy us every time, lad. Remember when I told you that?¡±
   ¡°I remember,¡± Jon said sullenly. He did not care to talk of his father¡¯s death, not even to Mormont.
   ¡°See that you never forget it. The hard truths are the ones to hold tight. Fetch me my plate. Is it ham again? So be it. You look weary. Was your moonlight ride so tiring?¡±
   Jon¡¯s throat was dry. ¡°You know?¡±
   ¡°Know,¡± the raven echoed from Mormont¡¯s shoulder. ¡°Know.¡±
   The Old Bear snorted. ¡°Do you think they chose me Lord Commander of the Night¡¯s Watch because I¡¯m dumb as a stump, Snow? Aemon told me you¡¯d go. I told him you¡¯d be back. I know my men?.?.?.?and my boys too. Honor set you on the kingsroad?.?.?.?and honor brought you back.¡±
   ¡°My friends brought me back,¡± Jon said.
   ¡°Did I say it was your honor?¡± Mormont inspected his plate.
   ¡°They killed my father. Did you expect me to do nothing?¡±
   ¡°If truth be told, we expected you to do just as you did.¡± Mormont tried a plum, spit out the pit. ¡°I ordered a watch kept over you., You were seen leaving. If your brothers had not fetched you back, you would have been taken along the way, and not by friends. Unless you have a horse with wings like a raven. Do you?¡±
   ¡°No.¡± Jon felt like a fool.
   ¡°Pity, we could use a horse like that.¡±
   Jon stood tall. He told himself that he would die well; that much he could do, at the least. ¡°I know the penalty for desertion, my lord. I¡¯m not afraid to die.¡±
   ¡°Die!¡± the raven cried.
   ¡°Nor live, I hope,¡± Mormont said, cutting his ham with a dagger and feeding a bite to the bird. ¡°You have not deserted, yet. Here you stand. If we beheaded every boy who rode to Mole¡¯s Town in the night, only ghosts would guard the Wall. Yet maybe you mean to flee again on the morrow, or a fortnight from now. Is that it? Is that your hope, boy?¡±
   Jon kept silent.
   ¡°I thought so.¡± Mormont peeled the shell off a boiled egg. ¡°Your father is dead, lad. Do you think you can bring him back?¡±
   ¡°No,¡± he answered, sullen.
   ¡°Good,¡± Mormont said. ¡°We¡¯ve seen the dead come back, you and me, and it¡¯s not something I care to see again.¡± He ate the egg in two bites and flicked a bit of shell out from between his teeth. ¡°Your brother is in the field with all the power of the north behind him. Any one of his lords bannermen commands more swords than you¡¯ll find in all the Night¡¯s Watch. Why do you imagine that they need your help? Are you such a mighty warrior, or do you carry a grumkin in your pocket to magic up your sword?¡±
   Jon had no answer for him. The raven was pecking at an egg, breaking the shell. Pushing his beak through the hole, he pulled out morsels of white and yoke.
   The Old Bear sighed. ¡°You are not the only one touched by this war. Like as not, my sister is marching in your brother¡¯s host, her and those daughters of hers, dressed in men¡¯s mail. Maege is a hoary old snark, stubborn, short-tempered, and willful. Truth be told, I can hardly stand to be around the wretched woman, but that does not mean my love for her is any less than the love you bear your half sisters.¡± Frowning, Mormont took his last egg and squeezed it in his fist until the shell crunched. ¡°Or perhaps it does. Be that as it may, I¡¯d still grieve if she were slain, yet you don¡¯t see me running off. I said the words, just as you did. My place is here?.?.?.?where is yours, boy?¡±
   I have no place, Jon wanted to say, I¡¯m a bastard, I have no rights, no name, no mother, and now not even a father. The words would not come. ¡°I don¡¯t know.¡±
   ¡°I do,¡± said Lord Commander Mormont. ¡°The cold winds are rising, Snow. Beyond the Wall, the shadows lengthen. Cotter Pyke writes of vast herds of elk, streaming south and east toward the sea, and mammoths as well. He says one of his men discovered huge, misshapen footprints not three leagues from Eastwatch. Rangers from the Shadow Tower have found whole villages abandoned, and at night Ser Denys says they see fires in the mountains, huge blazes that burn from dusk till dawn. Quorin Halfhand took a captive in the depths of the Gorge, and the man swears that Mance Rayder is massing all his people in some new, secret stronghold he¡¯s found, to what end the gods only know. Do you think your uncle Benjen was the only ranger we¡¯ve lost this past year?¡±
   ¡°Ben Jen,¡± the raven squawked, bobbing its head, bits of egg dribbling from its beak. ¡°Ben Jen. Ben Jen.¡±
   ¡°No,¡± Jon said. There had been others. Too many.
   ¡°Do you think your brother¡¯s war is more important than ours?¡± the old man barked.
   Jon chewed his lip. The raven flapped its wings at him. ¡°War, war, war, war,¡± it sang.
   ¡°It¡¯s not,¡± Mormont told him. ¡°Gods save us, boy, you¡¯re not blind and you¡¯re not stupid. When dead men come hunting in the night, do you think it matters who sits the Iron Throne?¡±
   ¡°No.¡± Jon had not thought of it that way.
   ¡°Your lord father sent you to us, Jon. Why, who can say?¡±
   ¡°Why? Why? Why?¡± the raven called.
   ¡°All I know is that the blood of the First Men flows in the veins of the Starks. The First Men built the Wall, and it¡¯s said they remember things otherwise forgotten. And that beast of yours?.?.?.?he led us to the wights, warned you of the dead man on the steps. Ser Jaremy would doubtless call that happenstance, yet Ser Jaremy is dead and I¡¯m not.¡± Lord Mormont stabbed a chunk of ham with the point of his dagger. ¡°I think you were meant to be here, and I want you and that wolf of yours with us when we go beyond the Wall.¡±
   His words sent a chill of excitement down Jon¡¯s back. ¡°Beyond the Wall?¡±
   ¡°You heard me. I mean to find Ben Stark, alive or dead.¡± He chewed and swallowed. ¡°I will not sit here meekly and wait for the snows and the ice winds. We must know what is happening. This time the Night¡¯s Watch will ride in force, against the King-beyond-the-Wall, the Others, and anything else that may be out there. I mean to command them myself.¡± He pointed his dagger at Jon¡¯s chest. ¡°By custom, the Lord Commander¡¯s steward is his squire as well?.?.?.?but I do not care to wake every dawn wondering if you¡¯ve run off again. So I will have an answer from you, Lord Snow, and I will have it now. Are you a brother of the Night¡¯s Watch?.?.?.?or only a bastard boy who wants to play at war?¡±
   Jon Snow straightened himself and took a long deep breath. Forgive me, Father. Robb, Arya, Bran?.?.?.?forgive me, I cannot help you. He has the truth of it. This is my place. ¡°I am?.?.?.?yours, my lord. Your man. I swear it. I will not run again.¡±
   The Old Bear snorted. ¡°Good. Now go put on your sword.¡±
   
   CATELYN
   It seemed a thousand years ago that Catelyn Stark had carried her infant son out of Riverrun, crossing the Tumblestone in a small boat to begin their journey north to Winterfell. And it was across the Tumblestone that they came home now, though the boy wore plate and mail in place of swaddling clothes.
   Robb sat in the bow with Grey Wind, his hand resting on his direwolf s head as the rowers pulled at their oars. Theon Greyjoy was with him. Her uncle Brynden would come behind in the second boat, with the Greatjon and Lord Karstark.
   Catelyn took a place toward the stern. They shot down the Tumblestone, letting the strong current push them past the looming Wheel Tower. The splash and rumble of the great waterwheel within was a sound from her girlhood that brought a sad smile to Catelyn¡¯s face. From the sandstone walls of the castle, soldiers and servants shouted down her name, and Robb¡¯s, and ¡°Winterfell!¡± From every rampart waved the banner of House Tully: a leaping trout, silver, against a rippling blue-and-red field. It was a stirring sight, yet it did not lift her heart. She wondered if indeed her heart would ever lift again. Oh, Ned?.?.?.?
   Below the Wheel Tower, they made a wide turn and knifed through the churning water. The men put their backs into it. The wide arch of the Water Gate came into view, and she heard the creak of heavy chains as the great iron portcullis was winched upward. It rose slowly as they approached, and Catelyn saw that the lower half of it was red with rust. The bottom foot dripped brown mud on them as they passed underneath, the barbed spikes mere inches above their heads. Catelyn gazed up at the bars and wondered how deep the rust went and how well the portcullis would stand up to a ram and whether it ought to be replaced. Thoughts like that were seldom far from her mind these days.
   They passed beneath the arch and under the walls, moving from sunlight to shadow and back into sunlight. Boats large and small were tied up all around them, secured to iron rings set in the stone. Her father¡¯s guards waited on the water stair with her brother. Ser Edmure Tully was a stocky young man with a shaggy head of auburn hair and a fiery beard. His breastplate was scratched and dented from battle, his blue-and-red cloak stained by blood and smoke. At his side stood the Lord Tytos Blackwood, a hard pike of a man with close-cropped salt-and-pepper whiskers and a hook nose. His bright yellow armor was inlaid with jet in elaborate vine-and-leaf patterns, and a cloak sewn from raven feathers draped his thin shoulders. It had been Lord Tytos who led the sortie that plucked her brother from the Lannister camp.
   ¡°Bring them in,¡± Ser Edmure commanded. Three men scrambled down the stairs knee-deep in the water and pulled the boat close with long hooks. When Grey Wind bounded out, one of them dropped his pole and lurched back, stumbling and sitting down abruptly in the river. The others laughed, and the man got a sheepish look on his face. Theon Greyjoy vaulted over the side of the boat and lifted Catelyn by the waist, setting her on a dry step above him as water lapped around his boots.
   Edmure came down the steps to embrace her. ¡°Sweet sister,¡± he murmured hoarsely. He had deep blue eyes and a mouth made for smiles, but he was not smiling now. He looked worn and tired, battered by battle and haggard from strain. His neck was bandaged where he had taken a wound. Catelyn hugged him fiercely.
   ¡°Your grief is mine, Cat,¡± he said when they broke apart. ¡°When we heard about Lord Eddard?.?.?.?the Lannisters will pay, I swear it, you will have your vengeance.¡±
   ¡°Will that bring Ned back to me?¡± she said sharply. The wound was still too fresh for softer words. She could not think about Ned now. She would not. It would not do. She had to be strong. ¡°All that will keep. I must see Father.¡±
   ¡°He awaits you in his solar,¡± Edmure said.
   ¡°Lord Hoster is bedridden, my lady,¡± her father¡¯s steward explained. When had that good man grown so old and grey? ¡°He instructed me to bring you to him at once.¡±
   ¡°I¡¯ll take her.¡± Edmure escorted her up the water stair and across the lower bailey, where Petyr Baelish and Brandon Stark had once crossed swords for her favor. The massive sandstone walls of the keep loomed above them. As they pushed through a door between two guardsmen in fish-crest helms, she asked, ¡°How bad is he?¡± dreading the answer even as she said the words.
   Edmure¡¯s look was somber. ¡°He will not be with us long, the maesters say. The pain is?.?.?.?constant, and grievous.¡±
   A blind rage filled her, a rage at all the world; at her brother Edmure and her sister Lysa, at the Lannisters, at the maesters, at Ned and her father and the monstrous gods who would take them both away from her. ¡°You should have told me,¡± she said. ¡°You should have sent word as soon as you knew.¡±
   ¡°He forbade it. He did not want his enemies to know that he was dying. With the realm so troubled, he feared that if the Lannisters suspected how frail he was?.?.?.?¡±
   ¡°?.?.?.?they might attack?¡± Catelyn finished, hard. It was your doing, yours, a voice whispered inside her. If you had not taken it upon yourself to seize the dwarf?.?.?.?
   They climbed the spiral stair in silence.
   The keep was three-sided, like Riverrun itself, and Lord Hoster¡¯s solar was triangular as well, with a stone balcony that jutted out to the east like the prow of some great sandstone ship. From there the lord of the castle could look down on his walls and battlements, and beyond, to where the waters met. They had moved her father¡¯s bed out onto the balcony. ¡°He likes to sit in the sun and watch the rivers,¡± Edmure explained. ¡°Father, see who I¡¯ve brought. Cat has come to see you?.?.?.?¡±
   Hoster Tully had always been a big man; tall and broad in his youth, portly as he grew older. Now he seemed shrunken, the muscle and meat melted off his bones. Even his face sagged. The last time Catelyn had seen him, his hair and beard had been brown, well streaked with grey. Now they had gone white as snow.
   His eyes opened to the sound of Edmure¡¯s voice. ¡°Little cat,¡± he murmured in a voice thin and wispy and wracked by pain. ¡°My little cat.¡± A tremulous smile touched his face as his hand groped for hers. ¡°I watched for you?.?.?.?¡±
   ¡°I shall leave you to talk,¡± her brother said, kissing their lord father gently on the brow before he withdrew.
   Catelyn knelt and took her father¡¯s hand in hers. It was a big hand, but fleshless now, the bones moving loosely under the skin, all the strength gone from it. ¡°You should have told me,¡± she said. ¡°A rider, a raven?.?.?.?¡±
   ¡°Riders are taken, questioned,¡± he answered. ¡°Ravens are brought down?.?.?.?¡± A spasm of pain took him, and his fingers clutched hers hard. ¡°The crabs are in my belly?.?.?.?pinching, always pinching. Day and night. They have fierce claws, the crabs. Maester Vyman makes me dreamwine, milk of the poppy?.?.?.?I sleep a lot?.?.?.?but I wanted to be awake to see you, when you came. I was afraid?.?.?.?when the Lannisters took your brother, the camps all around us?.?.?.?was afraid I would go, before I could see you again?.?.?.?I was afraid?.?.?.?¡± 
   ¡°I¡¯m here, Father,¡± she said. ¡°With Robb, my son. He¡¯ll want to see you too.¡±
   ¡°Your boy,¡± he whispered. ¡°He had my eyes, I remember?.?.?.?¡±
   ¡°He did, and does. And we¡¯ve brought you Jaime Lannister, in irons. Riverrun is free again, Father.¡±
   Lord Hoster smiled. ¡°I saw. Last night, when it began, I told them?.?.?.?had to see. They carried me to the gatehouse?.?.?.?watched from the battlements. Ah, that was beautiful?.?.?.?the torches came in a wave, I could hear the cries floating across the river?.?.?.?sweet cries?.?.?.?when that siege tower went up, gods?.?.?.?would have died then, and glad, if only I could have seen you children first. Was it your boy who did it? Was it your Robb?¡±
   ¡°Yes,¡± Catelyn said, fiercely proud. ¡°It was Robb?.?.?.?and Brynden. Your brother is here as well, my lord.¡±
   ¡°Him.¡± Her father¡¯s voice was a faint whisper. ¡°The Blackfish?.?.?.?came back? From the Vale?¡±
   ¡°Yes.¡±
   ¡°And Lysa?¡± A cool wind moved through his thin white hair. ¡°Gods be good, your sister?.?.?.?did she come as well?¡±
   He sounded so full of hope and yearning that it was hard to tell the truth. ¡°No. I¡¯m sorry?.?.?.?¡±
   ¡°Oh.¡± His face fell, and some light went out of his eyes. ¡°I¡¯d hoped I would have liked to see her, before?.?.?.?¡±
   ¡°She¡¯s with her son, in the Eyrie.¡±
   Lord Hoster gave a weary nod. ¡°Lord Robert now, poor Arryn¡¯s gone?.?.?.?I remember?.?.?.?why did she not come with you?¡±
   ¡°She is frightened, my lord. In the Eyrie she feels safe.¡± She kissed his wrinkled brow. ¡°Robb will be waiting. Will you see him? And Brynden?¡±
   ¡°Your son,¡± he whispered. ¡°Yes. Cat¡¯s child?.?.?.?he had my eyes, I remember. When he was born. Bring him ?.?.?.?yes.¡±
   ¡°And your brother?¡±
   Her father glanced out over the rivers. ¡°Blackfish,¡± he said. ¡°Has he wed yet? Taken some?.?.?.?girl to wife?¡±
   Even on his deathbed, Catelyn thought sadly. ¡°He has not wed. You know that, Father. Nor will he ever.¡±
   ¡°I told him?.?.?.?commanded him. Marry! I was his lord. He knows. My right, to make his match. A good match. A Redwyne. Old House. Sweet girl, pretty?.?.?.?freckles?.?.?.?Bethany, yes. Poor child. Still waiting. Yes. Still?.?.?.?¡±
   ¡°Bethany Redwyne wed Lord Rowan years ago,¡± Catelyn reminded him. ¡°She has three children by him.¡±
   ¡°Even so,¡± Lord Hoster muttered. ¡°Even so. Spit on the girl. The Redwynes. Spit on me. His lord, his brother?.?.?.?that Blackfish. I had other offers. Lord Bracken¡¯s girl. Walder Frey?.?.?.?any of three, he said?.?.?.?Has he wed? Anyone? Anyone?¡±
   ¡°No one,¡± Catelyn said, ¡°yet he has come many leagues to see you, fighting his way back to Riverrun. I would not be here now, if Ser Brynden had not helped us.¡±
   ¡°He was ever a warrior,¡± her father husked. ¡°That he could do. Knight of the Gate, yes.¡± He leaned back and closed his eyes, inutterably weary. ¡°Send him. Later. I¡¯ll sleep now. Too sick to fight. Send him up later, the Blackfish?.?.?.?¡±
   Catelyn kissed him gently, smoothed his hair, and left him there in the shade of his keep, with his rivers flowing beneath. He was asleep before she left the solar.
   When she returned to the lower bailey, Ser Brynden Tully stood on the water stairs with wet boots, talking with the captain of Riverrun¡¯s guards. He came to her at once. ¡°Is he...¡±
   ¡°Dying,¡± she said. ¡°As we feared.¡±
   Her uncle¡¯s craggy face showed his pain plain. He ran his fingers through his thick grey hair. ¡°Will he see me?¡±
   She nodded. ¡°He says he is too sick to fight.¡±
   Brynden Blackfish chuckled. ¡°I am too old a soldier to believe that. Hoster will be chiding me about the Redwyne girl even as we light his funeral pyre, damn his bones.¡±
   Catelyn smiled, knowing it was true. ¡°I do not see Robb.¡±
   ¡°He went with Greyjoy to the hall, I believe.¡±
   Theon Greyjoy was seated on a bench in Riverrun¡¯s Great Hall, enjoying a horn of ale and regaling her father¡¯s garrison with an account of the slaughter in the Whispering Wood. ¡°Some tried to flee, but we¡¯d pinched the valley shut at both ends, and we rode out of the darkness with sword and lance. The Lannisters must have thought the Others themselves were on them when that wolf of Robb¡¯s got in among them. I saw him tear one man¡¯s arm from his shoulder, and their horses went mad at the scent of him. I couldn¡¯t tell you how many men were thrown...¡±
   ¡°Theon,¡± she interrupted, ¡°where might I find my son?¡±
   ¡°Lord Robb went to visit the godswood, my lady.¡±
   It was what Ned would have done. He is his father¡¯s son as much as mine, I must remember. Oh, gods, Ned?.?.?.?
   She found Robb beneath the green canopy of leaves, surrounded by tall redwoods and great old elms, kneeling before the heart tree, a slender weirwood with a face more sad than fierce. His longsword was before him, the point thrust in the earth, his gloved hands clasped around the hilt. Around him others knelt: Greatjon Umber, Rickard Karstark, Maege Mormont, Galbart Glover, and more. Even Tytos Blackwood was among them, the great raven cloak fanned out behind him. These are the ones who keep the old gods, she realized. She asked herself what gods she kept these days, and could not find an answer.
   It would not do to disturb them at their prayers. The gods must have their due?.?.?.?even cruel gods who would take Ned from her, and her lord father as well. So Catelyn waited. The river wind moved through the high branches, and she could see the Wheel Tower to her right, ivy crawling up its side. As she stood there, all the memories came flooding back to her. Her father had taught her to ride amongst these trees, and that was the elm that Edmure had fallen from when he broke his arm, and over there, beneath that bower, she and Lysa had played at kissing with Petyr.
   She had not thought of that in years. How young they all had been, she no older than Sansa, Lysa younger than Arya, and Petyr younger still, yet eager. The girls had traded him between them, serious and giggling by turns. It came back to her so vividly she could almost feel his sweaty fingers on her shoulders and taste the mint on his breath. There was always mint growing in the godswood, and Petyr had liked to chew it. He had been such a bold little boy, always in trouble. ¡°He tried to put his tongue in my mouth,¡± Catelyn had confessed to her sister afterward, when they were alone. ¡°He did with me too,¡± Lysa had whispered, shy and breathless. ¡°I liked it.¡±
   Robb got to his feet slowly and sheathed his sword, and Catelyn found herself wondering whether her son had ever kissed a girl in the godswood. Surely he must have. She had seen Jeyne Poole giving him moist-eyed glances, and some of the serving girls, even ones as old as eighteen?.?.?.?he had ridden in battle and killed men with a sword, surely he had been kissed. There were tears in her eyes. She wiped them away angrily.
   ¡°Mother,¡± Robb said when he saw her standing there. ¡°We must call a council. There are things to be decided.¡±
   ¡°Your grandfather would like to see you,¡± she said. ¡°Robb, he¡¯s very sick.¡±
   ¡°Ser Edmure told me. I am sorry, Mother?.?.?.?for Lord Hoster and for you. Yet first we must meet. We¡¯ve had word from the south. Renly Baratheon has claimed his brother¡¯s crown.¡±
   ¡°Renly?¡± she said, shocked. ¡°I had thought, surely it would be Lord Stannis?.?.?.?¡±
   ¡°So did we all, my lady,¡± Galbart Glover said.
   The war council convened in the Great Hall, at four long trestle tables arranged in a broken square. Lord Hoster was too weak to attend, asleep on his balcony, dreaming of the sun on the rivers of his youth. Edmure sat in the high seat of the Tullys, with Brynden Blackfish at his side, and his father¡¯s bannermen arrayed to right and left and along the side tables. Word of the victory at Riverrun had spread to the fugitive lords of the Trident, drawing them back. Karyl Vance came in, a lord now, his father dead beneath the Golden Tooth. Ser Marq Piper was with him, and they brought a Darry, Ser Raymun¡¯s son, a lad no older than Bran. Lord Jonos Bracken arrived from the ruins of Stone Hedge, glowering and blustering, and took a seat as far from Tytos Blackwood as the tables would permit.
   The northern lords sat opposite, with Catelyn and Robb facing her brother across the tables. They were fewer. The Greatjon sat at Robb¡¯s left hand, and then Theon Greyjoy; Galbart Glover and Lady Mormont were to the right of Catelyn. Lord Rickard Karstark, gaunt and hollow-eyed in his grief, took his seat like a man in a nightmare, his long beard uncombed and unwashed. He had left two sons dead in the Whispering Wood, and there was no word of the third, his eldest, who had led the Karstark spears against Tywin Lannister on the Green Fork.
   The arguing raged on late into the night. Each lord had a right to speak, and speak they did?.?.?.?and shout, and curse, and reason, and cajole, and jest, and bargain, and slam tankards on the table, and threaten, and walk out, and return sullen or smiling. Catelyn sat and listened to it all.
   Roose Bolton had re-formed the battered remnants of their other host at the mouth of the causeway. Ser Helman Tallhart and Walder Frey still held the Twins. Lord Tywin¡¯s army had crossed the Trident, and was making for Harrenhal. And there were two kings in the realm. Two kings, and no agreement.
   Many of the lords bannermen wanted to march on Harrenhal at once, to meet Lord Tywin and end Lannister power for all time. Young, hot-tempered Marq Piper urged a strike west at Casterly Rock instead. Still others counseled patience. Riverrun sat athwart the Lannister supply lines, Jason Mallister pointed out; let them bide their time, denying Lord Tywin fresh levies and provisions while they strengthened their defenses and rested their weary troops. Lord Blackwood would have none of it. They should finish the work they began in the Whispering Wood. March to Harrenhal and bring Roose Bolton¡¯s army down as well. What Blackwood urged, Bracken opposed, as ever; Lord Jonos Bracken rose to insist they ought pledge their fealty to King Renly, and move south to join their might to his.
   ¡°Renly is not the king,¡± Robb said. It was the first time her son had spoken. Like his father, he knew how to listen.
   ¡°You cannot mean to hold to Joffrey, my lord,¡± Galbart Glover said. ¡°He put your father to death.¡±
   ¡°That makes him evil,¡± Robb replied. ¡°I do not know that it makes Renly king. Joffrey is still Robert¡¯s eldest trueborn son, so the throne is rightfully his by all the laws of the realm. Were he to die, and I mean to see that he does, he has a younger brother. Tommen is next in line after Joffrey.¡±
   ¡°Tommen is no less a Lannister,¡± Ser Marq Piper snapped.
   ¡°As you say,¡± said Robb, troubled. ¡°Yet if neither one is king, still, how could it be Lord Renly? He¡¯s Robert¡¯s younger brother. Bran can¡¯t be Lord of Winterfell before me, and Renly can¡¯t be king before Lord Stannis.¡±
   Lady Mormont agreed. ¡°Lord Stannis has the better claim.¡±
   ¡°Renly is crowned,¡± said Marq Piper. ¡°Highgarden and Storm¡¯s End support his claim, and the Dornishmen will not be laggardly. If Winterfell and Riverrun add their strength to his, he will have five of the seven great houses behind him. Six, if the Arryns bestir themselves! Six against the Rock! My lords, within the year, we will have all their heads on pikes, the queen and the boy king, Lord Tywin, the Imp, the Kingslayer, Ser Kevan, all of them! That is what we shall win if we join with King Renly. What does Lord Stannis have against that, that we should cast it all aside?¡±
   ¡°The right,¡± said Robb stubbornly. Catelyn thought he sounded eerily like his father as he said it.
   ¡°So you mean us to declare for Stannis?¡± asked Edmure.
   ¡°I don¡¯t know,¡± said Robb. ¡°I prayed to know what to do, but the gods did not answer. The Lannisters killed my father for a traitor, and we know that was a lie, but if Joffrey is the lawful king and we fight against him, we will be traitors.¡±
   ¡°My lord father would urge caution,¡± aged Ser Stevron said, with the weaselly smile of a Frey. ¡°Wait, let these two kings play their game of thrones. When they are done fighting, we can bend our knees to the victor, or oppose him, as we choose. With Renly arming, likely Lord Tywin would welcome a truce ?.?.?.?and the safe return of his son. Noble lords, allow me to go to him at Harrenhal and arrange good terms and ransoms?.?.?.?¡±
   A roar of outrage drowned out his voice. ¡°Craven!¡± the Greatjon thundered. ¡°Begging for a truce will make us seem weak,¡± declared Lady Mormont. ¡°Ransoms be damned, we must not give up the Kingslayer,¡± shouted Rickard Karstark.
   ¡°Why not a peace?¡± Catelyn asked.
   The lords looked at her, but it was Robb¡¯s eyes she felt, his and his alone. ¡°My lady, they murdered my lord father, your husband,¡± he said grimly. He unsheathed his longsword and laid it on the table before him, the bright steel on the rough wood. ¡°This is the only peace I have for Lannisters.¡±
   The Greatjon bellowed his approval, and other men added their voices, shouting and drawing swords and pounding their fists on the table. Catelyn waited until they had quieted. ¡°My lords,¡± she said then, ¡°Lord Eddard was your liege, but I shared his bed and bore his children. Do you think I love him any less than you?¡± Her voice almost broke with her grief, but Catelyn took a long breath and steadied herself. ¡°Robb, if that sword could bring him back, I should never let you sheathe it until Ned stood at my side once more?.?.?.?but he is gone, and hundred Whispering Woods will not change that. Ned is gone, and Daryn Hornwood, and Lord Karstark¡¯s valiant sons, and many other good men besides, and none of them will return to us. Must we have more deaths still?¡±
   ¡°You are a woman, my lady,¡± the Greatjon rumbled in his deep voice. ¡°Women do not understand these things.¡±
   ¡°You are the gentle sex,¡± said Lord Karstark, with the lines of grief fresh on his face. ¡°A man has a need for vengeance.¡±
   ¡°Give me Cersei Lannister, Lord Karstark, and you would see how gentle a woman can be,¡± Catelyn replied. ¡°Perhaps I do not understand tactics and strategy?.?.?.?but I understand futility. We went to war when Lannister armies were ravaging the riverlands, and Ned was a prisoner, falsely accused of treason. We fought to defend ourselves, and to win my lord¡¯s freedom.
   ¡°Well, the one is done, and the other forever beyond our reach. I will mourn for Ned until the end of my days, but I must think of the living. I want my daughters back, and the queen holds them still. If I must trade our four Lannisters for their two Starks, I will call that a bargain and thank the gods. I want you safe, Robb, ruling at Winterfell from your father¡¯s seat. I want you to live your life, to kiss a girl and wed a woman and father a son. I want to write an end to this. I want to go home, my lords, and weep for my husband.¡±
   The hall was very quiet when Catelyn finished speaking.
   ¡°Peace,¡± said her uncle Brynden. ¡°Peace is sweet, my lady?.?.?.?but on what terms? It is no good hammering your sword into a plowshare if you must forge it again on the morrow.¡±
   ¡°What did Torrhen and my Eddard die for, if I am to return to Karhold with nothing but their bones?¡± asked Rickard Karstark.
   ¡°Aye,¡± said Lord Bracken. ¡°Gregor Clegane laid waste to my fields, slaughtered my smallfolk, and left Stone Hedge a smoking ruin. Am I now to bend the knee to the ones who sent him? What have we fought for, if we are to put all back as it was before?¡±
   Lord Blackwood agreed, to Catelyn¡¯s surprise and dismay. ¡°And if we do make peace with King Joffrey, are we not then traitors to King Renly? What if the stag should prevail against the lion, where would that leave us?¡±
   ¡°Whatever you may decide for yourselves, I shall never call a Lannister my king,¡± declared Marq Piper.
   ¡°Nor I!¡± yelled the little Darry boy. ¡°I never will!¡±
   Again the shouting began. Catelyn sat despairing. She had come so close, she thought. They had almost listened, almost?.?.?.?but the moment was gone. There would be no peace, no chance to heal, no safety. She looked at her son, watched him as he listened to the lords debate, frowning, troubled, yet wedded to his war. He had pledged himself to marry a daughter of Walder Frey, but she saw his true bride plain before her now: the sword he had laid on the table.
   Catelyn was thinking of her girls, wondering if she would ever see them again, when the Greatjon lurched to his feet.
   ¡°MY LORDS!¡± he shouted, his voice booming off the rafters. ¡°Here is what I say to these two kings!¡± He spat. ¡° Renly Baratheon is nothing to me, nor Stannis neither. Why should they rule over me and mine, from some flowery seat in Highgarden or Dorne? What do they know of the Wall or the wolfswood or the barrows of the First Men? Even their gods are wrong. The Others take the Lannisters too, I¡¯ve had a bellyful of them.¡± He reached back over his shoulder and drew his immense two-handed greatsword. ¡°Why shouldn¡¯t we rule ourselves again? It was the dragons we married, and the dragons are all dead!¡± He pointed at Robb with the blade. ¡°There sits the only king I mean to bow my knee to, m¡¯lords,¡± he thundered. ¡°The King in the North!¡±
   And he knelt, and laid his sword at her son¡¯s feet.
   ¡°I¡¯ll have peace on those terms,¡± Lord Karstark said. ¡°They can keep their red castle and their iron chair as well.¡± He eased his longsword from its scabbard. ¡°The King in the North!¡± he said, kneeling beside the Greatjon.
   Maege Mormont stood. ¡°The King of Winter!¡± she declared, and laid her spiked mace beside the swords. And the river lords were rising too, Blackwood and Bracken and Mallister, houses who had never been ruled from Winterfell, yet Catelyn watched them rise and draw their blades, bending their knees and shouting the old words that had not been heard in the realm for more than three hundred years, since Aegon the Dragon had come to make the Seven Kingdoms one?.?.?.?yet now were heard again, ringing from the timbers of her father¡¯s hall:
   ¡°The King in the North!¡±
   ¡°The King in the North!¡±
   ¡°THE KING IN THE NORTH!¡±
   
   DAENERYS
   The land was red and dead and parched, and good wood was hard to come by. Her foragers returned with gnarled cottonwoods, purple brush, sheaves of brown grass. They took the two straightest trees, hacked the limbs and branches from them, skinned off their bark, and split them, laying the logs in a square. Its center they filled with straw, brush, bark shavings, and bundles of dry grass. Rakharo chose a stallion from the small herd that remained to them; he was not the equal of Khal Drogo¡¯s red, but few horses were. In the center of the square, Aggo fed him a withered apple and dropped him in an instant with an axe blow between the eyes.
   Bound hand and foot, Mirri Maz Duur watched from the dust with disquiet in her black eyes. ¡°It is not enough to kill a horse,¡± she told Dany. ¡°By itself, the blood is nothing. You do not have the words to make a spell, nor the wisdom to find them. Do you think bloodmagic is a game for children? You call me maegi as if it were a curse, but all it means is wise. You are a child, with a child¡¯s ignorance. Whatever you mean to do, it will not work. Loose me from these bonds and I will help you.¡±
   ¡°I am tired of the maegi¡¯s braying,¡± Dany told Jhogo. He took his whip to her, and after that the godswife kept silent.
   Over the carcass of the horse, they built a platform of hewn logs; trunks of smaller trees and limbs from the greater, and the thickest straightest branches they could find. They laid the wood east to west, from sunrise to sunset. On the platform they piled Khal Drogo¡¯s treasures: his great tent, his painted vests, his saddles and harness, the whip his father had given him when he came to manhood, the arakh he had used to slay Khal Ogo and his son, a mighty dragonbone bow. Aggo would have added the weapons Drogo¡¯s bloodriders had given Dany for bride gifts as well, but she forbade it. ¡°Those are mine,¡± she told him, ¡°and I mean to keep them.¡± Another layer of brush was piled about the khal¡¯s treasures, and bundles of dried grass scattered over them.
   Ser Jorah Mormont drew her aside as the sun was creeping toward its zenith. ¡°Princess?.?.?.?¡± he began.
   ¡°Why do you call me that?¡± Dany challenged him. ¡°My brother Viserys was your king, was he not?¡±
   ¡°He was, my lady.¡±
   ¡°Viserys is dead. I am his heir, the last blood of House Targaryen. Whatever was his is mine now.¡±
   ¡°My?.?.?.?queen,¡± Ser Jorah said, going to one knee. ¡°My sword that was his is yours, Dacnerys. And my heart as well, that never belonged to your brother. I am only a knight, and I have nothing to offer you but exile, but I beg you, hear me. Let Khal Drogo go. You shall not be alone. I promise you, no man shall take you to Vaes Dothrak unless you wish to go. You need not join the dosh khaleen. Come east with me. Yi Ti, Qarth, the Jade Sea, Asshai by the Shadow. We will see all the wonders yet unseen, and drink what wines the gods see fit to serve us. Please, Khaleesi. I know what you intend. Do not. Do not.¡±
   ¡°I must,¡± Dany told him. She touched his face, fondly, sadly. ¡°You do not understand.¡±
   ¡°I understand that you loved him,¡± Ser Jorah said in a voice thick with despair. ¡°I loved my lady wife once, yet I did not die with her. You are my queen, my sword is yours, but do not ask me to stand aside as you climb on Drogo¡¯s pyre. I will not watch you burn.¡±
   ¡°Is that what you fear?¡± Dany kissed him lightly on his broad forehead. ¡°I am not such a child as that, sweet ser.¡±
   ¡°You do not mean to die with him? You swear it, my queen?¡±
   ¡°I swear it,¡± she said in the Common Tongue of the Seven Kingdoms that by rights were hers.
   The third level of the platform was woven of branches no thicker than a finger, and covered with dry leaves and twigs. They laid them north to south, from ice to fire, and piled them high with soft cushions and sleeping silks. The sun had begun to lower toward the west by the time they were done. Dany called the Dothraki around her. Fewer than a hundred were left. How many had Aegon started with? she wondered. It did not matter.
   ¡°You will be my khalasar,¡± she told them. ¡°I see the faces of slaves. I free you. Take off your collars. Go if you wish, no one shall harm you. If you stay, it will be as brothers and sisters, husbands and wives.¡± The black eyes watched her, wary, expressionless. ¡°I see the children, women, the wrinkled faces of the aged. I was a child yesterday. Today I am a woman. Tomorrow I will be old. To each of you I say, give me your hands and your hearts, and there will always be a place for you.¡± She turned to the three young warriors of her khas. ¡°Jhogo, to you I give the silver-handled whip that was my bride gift, and name you ko, and ask your oath, that you will live and die as blood of my blood, riding at my side to keep me safe from harm.¡±
   Jhogo took the whip from her hands, but his face was confused. ¡°Khaleesi, ¡° he said hesitantly, ¡°this is not done. It would shame me, to be bloodrider to a woman.¡±
   ¡°Aggo,¡± Dany called, paying no heed to Jhogo¡¯s words. If I look back I am lost. ¡°To you I give the dragonbone bow that was my bride gift.¡± It was double-curved, shiny black and exquisite, taller than she was. ¡°I name you ko, and ask your oath, that you should live and die as blood of my blood, riding at my side to keep me safe from harm.¡±
   Aggo accepted the bow with lowered eyes. ¡°I cannot say these words. Only a man can lead a khalasar or name a ko.¡±
   ¡°Rakharo,¡± Dany said, turning away from the refusal, ¡°you shall have the great arakh that was my bride gift, with hilt and blade chased in gold. And you too I name my ko, and ask that you live and die as blood of my blood, riding at my side to keep me safe from harm.¡±
   ¡°You are khaleesi,¡± Rakharo said, taking the arakh. ¡°I shall ride at your side to Vaes Dothrak beneath the Mother of Mountains, and keep you safe from harm until you take your place with the crones of the dosh khaleen. No more can I promise.¡±
   She nodded, as calmly as if she had not heard his answer, and turned to the last of her champions. ¡°Ser Jorah Mormont,¡± she said, ¡°first and greatest of my knights, I have no bride gift to give you, but I swear to you, one day you shall have from my hands a longsword like none the world has ever seen, dragon-forged and made of Valyrian steel. And I would ask for your oath as well.¡±
   ¡°You have it, my queen,¡± Ser Jorah said, kneeling to lay his sword at her feet. ¡°I vow to serve you, to obey you, to die for you if need be.¡±
   ¡°Whatever may come?¡±
   ¡°Whatever may come.¡±
   ¡°I shall hold you to that oath. I pray you never regret the giving of it.¡± Dany lifted him to his feet. Stretching on her toes to reach his lips, she kissed the knight gently and said, ¡°You are the first of my Queensguard.¡±
   She could feel the eyes of the khalasar on her as she entered her tent. The Dothraki were muttering and giving her strange sideways looks from the corners of their dark almond eyes. They thought her mad, Dany realized. Perhaps she was. She would know soon enough. If I look back I am lost.
   Her bath was scalding hot when Irri helped her into the tub, but Dany did not flinch or cry aloud. She liked the heat. It made her feel clean. Jhiqui had scented the water with the oils she had found in the market in Vaes Dothrak; the steam rose moist and fragrant. Doreah washed her hair and combed it out, working loose the mats and tangles. Irri scrubbed her back. Dany closed her eyes and let the smell and the warmth enfold her. She could feel the heat soaking through the soreness between her thighs. She shuddered when it entered her, and her pain and stiffness seemed to dissolve. She floated.
   When she was clean, her handmaids helped her from the water. Irri and Jhiqui fanned her dry, while Doreah brushed her hair until it fell like a river of liquid silver down her back. They scented her with spiceflower and cinnamon; a touch on each wrist, behind her ears, on the tips of her milk-heavy breasts. The last dab was for her sex. Irri¡¯s finger felt as light and cool as a lover¡¯s kiss as it slid softly up between her lips.
   Afterward, Dany sent them all away, so she might prepare Khal Drogo for his final ride into the night lands. She washed his body clean and brushed and oiled his hair, running her fingers through it for the last time, feeling the weight of it, remembering the first time she had touched it, the night of their wedding ride. His hair had never been cut. How many men could die with their hair uncut? She buried her face in it and inhaled the dark fragrance of the oils. He smelled like grass and warm earth, like smoke and semen and horses. He smelled like Drogo. Forgive me, sun of my life, she thought. Forgive me for all I have done and all I must do. I paid the price, my star, but it was too high, too high?.?.?.?
   Dany braided his hair and slid the silver rings onto his mustache and hung his bells one by one. So many bells, gold and silver and bronze. Bells so his enemies would hear him coming and grow weak with fear. She dressed him in horsehair leggings and high boots, buckling a belt heavy with gold and silver medallions about his waist. Over his scarred chest she slipped a painted vest, old and faded, the one Drogo had loved best. For herself she chose loose sandsilk trousers, sandals that laced halfway up her legs, and a vest like Drogo¡¯s.
   The sun was going down when she called them back to carry his body to the pyre. The Dothraki watched in silence as Jhogo and Aggo bore him from the tent. Dany walked behind them. They laid him down on his cushions and silks, his head toward the Mother of Mountains far to the northeast.
   ¡°Oil,¡± she commanded, and they brought forth the jars and poured them over the pyre, soaking the silks and the brush and the bundles of dry grass, until the oil trickled from beneath the logs and the air was rich with fragrance. ¡°Bring my eggs,¡± Dany commanded her handmaids. Something in her voice made them run.
   Ser Jorah took her arm. ¡°My queen, Drogo will have no use for dragon¡¯s eggs in the night lands. Better to sell them in Asshai. Sell one and we can buy a ship to take us back to the Free Cities. Sell all three and you will be a wealthy woman all your days.¡±
   ¡°They were not given to me to sell,¡± Dany told him.
   She climbed the pyre herself to place the eggs around her sun-and-stars. The black beside his heart, under his arm. The green beside his head, his braid coiled around it. The cream-and-gold down between his legs. When she kissed him for the last time, Dany could taste the sweetness of the oil on his lips.
   As she climbed down off the pyre, she noticed Mirri Maz Duur watching her. ¡°You are mad,¡± the godswife said hoarsely.
   ¡°Is it so far from madness to wisdom?¡± Dany asked. ¡°Ser Jorah, take this maegi and bind her to the pyre.¡±
   ¡°To the?.?.?.?my queen, no, hear me?.?.?.?¡±
   ¡°Do as I say.¡± Still he hesitated, until her anger flared. ¡°You swore to obey me, whatever might come. Rakharo, help him.¡±
   The godswife did not cry out as they dragged her to Khal Drogo¡¯s pyre and staked her down amidst his treasures. Dany poured the oil over the woman¡¯s head herself. ¡°I thank you, Mirri Maz Duur,¡± she said, ¡°for the lessons you have taught me.¡±
   ¡°You will not hear me scream,¡± Mirri responded as the oil dripped from her hair and soaked her clothing.
   ¡°I will,¡± Dany said, ¡°but it is not your screams I want, only your life. I remember what you told me. Only death can pay for life.¡± Mirri Maz Duur opened her mouth, but made no reply. As she stepped away, Dany saw that the contempt was gone from the maegi¡¯s flat black eyes; in its place was something that might have been fear. Then there was nothing to be done but watch the sun and look for the first star.
   When a horselord dies, his horse is slain with him, so he might ride proud into the night lands. The bodies are burned beneath the open sky, and the khal rises on his fiery steed to take his place among the stars. The more fiercely the man burned in life, the brighter his star will shine in the darkness.
   Jhogo spied it first. ¡°There,¡± he said in a hushed voice. Dany looked and saw it, low in the east. The first star was a comet, burning red. Bloodred; fire red; the dragon¡¯s tail. She could not have asked for a stronger sign.
   Dany took the torch from Aggo¡¯s hand and thrust it between the logs. The oil took the fire at once, the brush and dried grass a heartbeat later. Tiny flames went darting up the wood like swift red mice, skating over the oil and leaping from bark to branch to leaf. A rising heat puffed at her face, soft and sudden as a lover¡¯s breath, but in seconds it had grown too hot to bear. Dany stepped backward. The wood crackled, louder and louder. Mirri Maz Duur began to sing in a shrill, ululating voice. The flames whirled and writhed, racing each other up the platform. The dusk shimmered as the air itself seemed to liquefy from the heat. Dany heard logs spit and crack. The fires swept over Mirri Maz Duur. Her song grew louder, shriller?.?.?.?then she gasped, again and again, and her song became a shuddering wail, thin and high and full of agony.
   And now the flames reached her Drogo, and now they were all around him. His clothing took fire, and for an instant the khal was clad in wisps of floating orange silk and tendrils of curling smoke, grey and greasy. Dany¡¯s lips parted and she found herself holding her breath. Part of her wanted to go to him as Ser Jorah had feared, to rush into the flames to beg for his forgiveness and take him inside her one last time, the fire melting the flesh from their bones until they were as one, forever.
   She could smell the odor of burning flesh, no different than horseflesh roasting in a firepit. The pyre roared in the deepening dusk like some great beast, drowning out the fainter sound of Mirri Maz Duur¡¯s screaming and sending up long tongues of flame to lick at the belly of the night. As the smoke grew thicker, the Dothraki backed away, coughing. Huge orange gouts of fire unfurled their banners in that hellish wind, the logs hissing and cracking, glowing cinders rising on the smoke to float away into the dark like so many newborn fireflies. The heat beat at the air with great red wings, driving the Dothraki back, driving off even Mormont, but Dany stood her ground. She was the blood of the dragon, and the fire was in her.
   She had sensed the truth of it long ago, Dany thought as she took a step closer to the conflagration, but the brazier had not been hot enough. The flames writhed before her like the women who had danced at her wedding, whirling and singing and spinning their yellow and orange and crimson veils, fearsome to behold, yet lovely, so lovely, alive with heat. Dany opened her arms to them, her skin flushed and glowing. This is a wedding, too, she thought. Mirri Maz Duur had fallen silent. The godswife thought her a child, but children grow, and children learn.
   Another step, and Dany could feel the heat of the sand on the soles of her feet, even through her sandals. Sweat ran down her thighs and between her breasts and in rivulets over her cheeks, where tears had once run. Ser Jorah was shouting behind her, but he did not matter anymore, only the fire mattered. The flames were so beautiful, the loveliest things she had ever seen, each one a sorcerer robed in yellow and orange and scarlet, swirling long smoky cloaks. She saw crimson firelions and great yellow serpents and unicorns made of pale blue flame; she saw fish and foxes and monsters, wolves and bright birds and flowering trees, each more beautiful than the last. She saw a horse, a great grey stallion limned in smoke, its flowing mane a nimbus of blue flame. Yes, my love, my sun-and-stars, yes, mount now, ride now.
   Her vest had begun to smolder, so Dany shrugged it off and let it fall to the ground. The painted leather burst into sudden flame as she skipped closer to the fire, her breasts bare to the blaze, streams of milk flowing from her red and swollen nipples. Now, she thought, now, and for an instant she glimpsed Khal Drogo before her, mounted on his smoky stallion, a flaming lash in his hand. He smiled, and the whip snaked down at the pyre, hissing.
   She heard a crack, the sound of shattering stone. The platform of wood and brush and grass began to shift and collapse in upon itself. Bits of burning wood slid down at her, and Dany was showered with ash and cinders. And something else came crashing down, bouncing and rolling, to land at her feet; a chunk of curved rock, pale and veined with gold, broken and smoking. The roaring filled the world, yet dimly through the firefall Dany heard women shriek and children cry out in wonder.
   Only death can pay for life.
   And there came a second crack, loud and sharp as thunder, and the smoke stirred and whirled around her and the pyre shifted, the logs exploding as the fire touched their secret hearts. She heard the screams of frightened horses, and the voices of the Dothraki raised in shouts of fear and terror, and Ser Jorah calling her name and cursing. No, she wanted to shout to him, no, my good knight, do not fear for me. The fire is mine. I am Daenerys Stormborn, daughter of dragons, bride of dragons, mother of dragons, don¡¯t you see? Don¡¯t you SEE? With a belch of flame and smoke that reached thirty feet into the sky, the pyre collapsed and came down around her. Unafraid, Dany stepped forward into the firestorm, calling to her children.
   The third crack was as loud and sharp as the breaking of the world.
   When the fire died at last and the ground became cool enough to walk upon, Ser Jorah Mormont found her amidst the ashes, surrounded by blackened logs and bits of glowing ember and the burnt bones of man and woman and stallion. She was naked, covered with soot, her clothes turned to ash, her beautiful hair all crisped away?.?.?.?yet she was unhurt.
   The cream-and-gold dragon was suckling at her left breast, the green-and-bronze at the right. Her arms cradled them close. The black-and-scarlet beast was draped across her shoulders, its long sinuous neck coiled under her chin. When it saw Jorah, it raised its head and looked at him with eyes as red as coals.
   Wordless, the knight fell to his knees. The men of her khas came up behind him. Jhogo was the first to lay his arakh at her feet. ¡°Blood of my blood,¡± he murmured, pushing his face to the smoking earth. ¡°Blood of my blood,¡± she heard Aggo echo. ¡°Blood of my blood,¡± Rakharo shouted.
   And after them came her handmaids, and then the others, all the Dothraki, men and women and children, and Dany had only to look at their eyes to know that they were hers now, today and tomorrow and forever, hers as they had never been Drogo¡¯s.
   As Daenerys Targaryen rose to her feet, her black hissed, pale smoke venting from its mouth and nostrils. The other two pulled away from her breasts and added their voices to the call, translucent wings unfolding and stirring the air, and for the first time in hundreds of years, the night came alive with the music of dragons.
